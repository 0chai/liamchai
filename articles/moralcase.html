		<h2>The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels by Alex Epstein</h2>

					
		<div class="post">

			<p>This book was a very important read for me. It was a view I was not exposed to. I liked his use of always coming back to the standard of value he held and arguing from there.</p>
<blockquote><p>Green Movement’s Standard of Value = Non-Impact of Nature<br>
Standard of Value of the Book = Flourishing of Human Life</p></blockquote>
<p>There were several assumptions I held that the book directly challenged. I haven’t yet double checked the sources given in the book – I suspect it will be a messy journey, but they do seem to hold true so far. Some examples that stood out for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we just stopped using fossil fuels today, billions of us will die.</li>
<li>Renewable energy like solar and wind have not solved the problem of <em>reliable </em>energy.</li>
<li>97% of scientists do not agree that climate change will lead to catastrophic results. This number seems to have been skewed.</li>
<li>If catastrophic climate change is coming, we would want to <em>increase</em> our fossil fuel use, not decrease it, as a way to protect ourselves.</li>
<li>Besides nuclear and hydroelectric, there are no viable alternatives to fossil fuels.</li>
<li>Fossil fuels are not running out any time soon, Three thousand years of coal reserves left, and coal can be transformed into oil or natural gas if needed.</li>
<li>Nuclear power is also abundant, there is A LOT of uranium and current technologies can only extract a small percent of the raw fission power</li>
<li>Earth does not have finite resources because resources do not come from the Earth – they come from the human ingenuity. Epstein gives the example of oil being a waste product, dumped into lakes until Rockfellar came in and found a way to use it.</li>
<li>If humanity can create conditions more of us to continue thinking and innovating, there is no fixed upper limit to the resources available (i.e. imagine we figure out free energy). These conditions need time and wealth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, below are my highlights. I highly highly recommend the book. Climate change is not a simple problem. It is extremely complex. I fear a greater danger than climate change itself are the people pushing for radical policies that lead to unintended consequences.</p>

1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>prediction by James Hansen, the most influential climate scientist in the world over the last thirty years: Dr. James E. Hansen of the Goddard Space Flight Center’s Institute for Space Studies said research by his institute showed that because of the “greenhouse effect” that results when gases prevent heat from escaping the earth’s atmosphere, global temperatures would rise early in the next century to “well above any level experienced in the past 100,000 years.”</p>

<p>Of course, predictions on a societal or global level can never be exact, but they need to be somewhere near the truth. So what happened? Two</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>think it’s good that we use a lot of fossil fuels. I think the world would be a much better place if people used a lot more</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>But fossil fuels cause climate change, she might have said. I agree, I would have replied, but I think the evidence shows that climate change, natural or man-made, is more manageable than ever</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>think the evidence shows that there are huge amounts of fossil fuels left, and we’ll have plenty of time to use ingenuity and technology to find something cheaper—such as some form of advanced nuclear power</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>It is conventional wisdom that our use of fossil fuels is an “addiction”—a short-range, unsustainable, destructive habit</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>Eighty-seven percent of the energy mankind uses every second, including most of the energy I am using as I write this, comes from burning one of the fossil fuels: coal, oil, or natural gas</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>But, we are told, this cannot continue</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>the argument goes, in the long run we are making our climate unlivable, destroying our environment, and depleting our resources. We must and can replace fossil fuels with renewable, green, climate-friendly energy from solar, wind, and biomass (plants).</p>

<p>CEO of Shell made in 2013: “We believe climate change is real and time is running out to take real action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”3</p>

<p>This is not a liberal view or a conservative view; it’s a view that almost everyone holds in one form or another</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>For years, the Nobel Prize–winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has demanded that the United States and other industrialized countries cut carbon dioxide emissions to 20 percent of 1990 levels by 2050—and the United States has joined hundreds of other countries in agreeing to this goal.5</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>So when the girl at the Greenpeace booth implied that I had sold my soul, I didn’t get offended. I simply explained that, no, I wasn’t being paid off; I had just concluded, based on my research, that the short- and long-term benefits of using fossil fuels actually far, far outweigh the risks and was happy to explain why. But she wasn’t interested. Pointing</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>I understand that a lot of smart people are predicting catastrophic consequences from using fossil fuels, I take that very seriously, and I have studied their predictions extensively.</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>leading experts and the media have been making the exact same predictions for more than thirty years. As far back as the 1970s they predicted that if we did not dramatically reduce fossil fuel use then, and use renewables instead, we would be experiencing catastrophe today—catastrophic resource depletion, catastrophic pollution, and catastrophic climate change</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>Instead, the exact opposite happened. Instead of using a lot less fossil fuel energy, we used a lot more—but instead of long-term catastrophe, we have experienced dramatic, long-term improvement in every aspect of life, including environmental quality</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>we should look at the track record of that idea, if it has one.</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>Take the prediction we hear today that we will soon run out of fossil fuels—particularly oil—because they are nonrenewable. This prediction was made over and over by some of the most prestigious thinkers of the 1970s</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>The Limits to Growth, which declared that its state-of-the-art computer models had demonstrated that we would run out of oil by 1992 and natural gas by 1993 (and, for good measure, gold, mercury, silver, tin, zinc, and lead by 1993 at the latest</p>

<p>In 1971 he said, “By the year 2000 the United Kingdom will be simply a small group of impoverished islands, inhabited by some 70 million hungry people,”9 and in 1974 he wrote, “America’s economic joyride is coming to an end: there will be no more cheap, abundant energy, no more cheap abundant food.”10</p>

<p>In a decade, urban dwellers will have to wear gas masks to survive air pollution . . . by 1985 air pollution will have reduced the amount of sunlight reaching earth by one half . . .”11</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>Air pollution . . . is certainly going to take hundreds of thousands of lives in the next few years alone,” he said in 1970.12</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>Reading back in time, I saw that many of the leaders who make that prediction now had, decades ago, predicted that we’d be living in catastrophe today.</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>it is possible that carbon-dioxide climate-induced famines could kill as many as a billion people before the year 2020.”16</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>all scientists’ agreed that warming was real and catastrophic in its potential,” a 1992 study reported.17</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>Just as the media today tell us these catastrophic predictions are a matter of scientific consensus, so did the media of the 1980s.</p>

<p>If I were a gambler, I would take even money that England will not exist in the year 2000.”18</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>All of these thinkers still advocate similar policies today—in fact, today Bill McKibben endorses a 95 percent ban on fossil fuel use, eight times as severe as the scenario described above!22 And all of them are extremely prestigious</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>Instead of following the leading advice and restricting the use of fossil fuels, people around the world nearly doubled their use of fossil fuels—which allegedly should have led to an epic disaster</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>Solar and wind are a minuscule portion of world energy use</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>While many countries wanted solar and wind, and in fact used a lot of their citizens’ money to prop up solar and wind companies, no one could figure out a cost-effective, scalable process to take sunlight and wind, which are dilute and intermittent forms of energy, and turn them into cheap, plentiful, reliable energy</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>

<p>What will promote human life? What will promote human flourishing—realizing the full potential of life</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>there is an incredibly strong correlation between fossil fuel use and life expectancy and between fossil fuel use and income, particularly in the rapidly developing parts of the world</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>China and India. In each country, both coal and oil use increased by at least a factor of 5, producing nearly all their energy.29</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>global malnutrition and undernourishment have plummeted—by 39 percent and 40 percent, respectively, since 1990</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>those who predict the most risk get the most attention from the media and from politicians who want to “do something</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>As we have used more fossil fuels, our resource situation, our environment situation, and our climate situation have been improving, too.</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>as fossil fuel use has increased, fossil fuel resources have increased. How is that possible?</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>measure for fossil fuel resources is “proven reserves,” which is the amount of coal, oil, or gas that is available to us affordably, given today’s technology</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>Many experts paid attention only to our consumption of oil and gas resources, but not our ability to create new oil and gas resources</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>It’s true that once we burn a barrel of oil, it’s gone. But it’s also true that human ingenuity can dramatically increase the amount of coal, oil, or gas that is available</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>in general, human beings are amazingly good at using ingenuity to create wealth, which means to create resources</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>We take the materials around us and make them more valuable; that’s how we went from starving in a cave to producing a cornucopia of food that we can enjoy in comfortable homes. The</p>

<p>We’ll look at all major measures of environmental quality in chapter 8,</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>fossil fuels, as we’ll discuss in chapter 6, can also improve our environment by powering machines that clean up nature’s health hazards, such as water purification plants that protect us from naturally contaminated water and sanitation systems that protect us from natural disease and animal waste</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>climate-related deaths</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>In the last eighty years, as CO2 emissions have most rapidly escalated, the annual rate of climate-related deaths worldwide fell by an incredible rate of 98 percent.41</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>We would have caused billions of premature deaths—deaths that were prevented by our increasing use of fossil fuels</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>tendency to ignore benefits and exaggerate risks</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>Whether our escalating use of fossil fuels is good or bad for us is a complex interdisciplinary question, and everyone is a nonexpert in many relevant issues</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>Ultimately, what we’re after in examining the benefits and risks of fossil fuels is to know big picture how they affect human life and what to do going forward</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>risks of burning coal compare to the benefits of burning coal</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>our fossil fuel use so far has been a moral choice because it has enabled billions of people to live longer and more fulfilling lives<br>
Such a tricky issue! When I hear people lament about the death of animal habitat and wild life – they are in a way implying that it would have been better to let billions of humans die instead – or to implement some form of massive contraception pill law. Idk! It’s tricky.</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>I hold human life as the standard of value</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>Many leading environmental thinkers, including those who predict fossil fuel catastrophe, hold as their standard of value what they call “pristine” nature or wilderness—nature unaltered by man</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>people are part of nature, but it isn’t true. Somewhere along the line—at about a billion [sic] years ago, maybe half that—we quit the contract and became a cancer</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>Until such time as Homo sapiens should decide to rejoin nature, some of us can only hope for the right virus to come along.45<br>
God. It’s so dangerous. These people are *literally* advocating genocide! The mantra goes: “we are doing this for Mother Earth!” And then proceed to use that as a justification for murdering billions of people because the planet is overpopulated.. it’s incredibly scary view.</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>McKibben is a biocentrist, and so am I. We are not interested in the utility of a particular species or free-flowing river, or ecosystem, to mankind. They have intrinsic value, more value—to me—than another human body, or a billion of them. Human happiness, and certainly human fecundity, are not as important as a wild and healthy planet</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>Though not in our time, and not in the time of our children, or their children, if we now, today, limited our numbers and our desires and our ambitions, perhaps nature could someday resume its independent working.”47</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>It is holding human nonimpact as one’s standard of value, without regard for human life and happiness</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>There is nothing intrinsically wrong with transforming our environment—to the contrary, that’s our means of survival</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>But we do want to avoid transforming our environment in a way that harms us now or in the long term</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>You might wonder how holding human life as your standard of value applies to preserving nature. It applies simply: preserve nature when doing so will benefit human life</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>By contrast, if nonimpact, not human life, is the standard, the moral thing to do is always leave nature alone</p>

1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>For example, in the 1980s, India had an environmentalist movement, called the Chipko movement, that made it nearly impossible for Indians to cut down forests to engage in industrial development. It was so bad that a movement literally called Log the Forest emerged to counter it</p>

1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>the humanist, which is the term I will use to describe someone on a human standard of value, treats the rest of nature as something to use for his benefit; the nonhumanist treats the rest of nature as something that must be served.</p>

1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>the vast majority of discussions on the issue are not clear about the standard of value being used, we need to always ask, when we hear any evaluation: “By what standard of value?</p>

1. THE SECRET HISTORY OF FOSSIL FUELS</p>
<p>by using the best energy technology today and in the coming decades, we pave the way for fossil fuel technologies not only to harness the copious amounts of fossil fuels remaining in the ground, of which we have just scratched the surface, but also to create the resources and time necessary to develop the next great energy technology.</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>There are two facts about energy that are missing from our discussion: one, people around the world need much, much more energy, and two, it’s extremely difficult to produce that energy cheaply and reliably. MACHINE</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>Industrial progress, mechanical improvement, all of the great wonders of the modern era have meant little to the wealthy. The rich in ancient Greece would have benefited hardly at all from modern plumbing—running servants replaced running water. Television and radio—the patricians of Rome could enjoy the leading musicians and actors in their home, could have the leading artists as domestic retainers. Ready-to-wear clothing, supermarkets—all these and many other modern developments would have added little to their life. They would have welcomed the improvements in transportation and in medicine, but for the rest, the great achievements of western capitalism have redounded primarily to the benefit of the ordinary person. These achievements have made available to the masses conveniences and amenities that were previously the exclusive prerogative of the rich and powerful.6</p>

2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>Workable is a challenge. Cheap and plentiful are an incredible challenge. Hazelnut energy is workable; it just isn’t likely going to be cheap and plentiful.</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>James Shikwati of the Inter Region Economic Network, explains why he resents programs to encourage underdeveloped countries to use solar or wind. The rich countries can afford to engage in some luxurious experimentation with other forms of energy, but for us we are still at the stage of survival. I don’t see how a solar panel is going to power a steel industry, how a solar panel is going to power a railway network, it might work, maybe, to power a small transistor radio.23</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>But the reality is that energy affects nearly every aspect of life. Almost nothing matters more to our lives, the lives of those you care about, and the lives of billions of others around the world than the existence of cheap, plentiful, reliable energy</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>This story should remind us of how “unnatural” our lives are—and why that’s a good thing</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>that more energy means more ability to improve our lives; less energy means less ability—more helplessness, more suffering, and more death<br>
You know I can see this exactly in living here at Villasur. That I am so utterly helpless – without a car, without well stocked supermarkets nearby, without an internet connection. My quality of life has dropped by moving to the rural village. Dropped quite dramatically. Where in London something like gingivitis would arise I would’ve been able to do very good research over a weekend, map out a plan of action and buy exactly the foods I needed from local shops or delivered very quickly that same week. I have been able to do somewhat the same here, but it’s been much much slower. Mainly because I don’t have easy access to internet.</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>we desperately need machines to do work for us because we are naturally very weak. Without machines to help us, we don’t have anywhere near all the energy that we need to survive and flourish</p>

2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>anytime we are worried about the risks of one way of doing things (here, using fossil fuel energy) we need to know the benefits and risks of the alternatives</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>Nineteenth-century coal technology is justifiably illegal today</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>But in the 1800s, it was and should have been perfectly legal to burn coal this way—because the alternative was death by cold or starvation or wretched poverty.</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>But if there is no equal or superior alternative, then any government action against fossil fuels, let alone the 50–95 percent bans over the next several decades that have been proposed, is a guaranteed early death sentence for billions—we would be willing to accept ten times more hurricanes if we had to. Energy is that important<br>
Yes. This is why when Joserra says let’s do direct action about climate change.. I am not bought in. You protest against using fossil fuels, but what is your new solution? If we just stop using fossil fuels, *people die*. Babies die. Elderly freeze. Food doesn’t arrive in supermarkets.</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>Other sources of energy, particularly nuclear and hydro, have been supplements, not replacements for fossil fuels</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>For the last thirty years, governments around the world—particularly European governments like Germany, Spain, and Denmark—have gone out of their way to promote non-fossil forms of energy, such as solar, wind, and biofuels</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>why is so much energy not made from alternatives?</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>The simple answer is: because it’s a really, really, really hard challenge to produce cheap, plentiful, reliable energy for billions of people—and the fossil fuel industry is the only one, by a mile, that’s figured out a solution</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>For something to be cheap and plentiful, every part of the process to produce it, including every input that goes into it, must be cheap and plentiful</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>In some cases, they may be cheap and reliable in small quantities—some people use French fry oil to power their cars—but making them cheap and reliable in large quantities, quantities sufficient to power the lives of billions of people, is a major feat.<br>
It’s all about scale scale scale.</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>

2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>Solar and wind energy both work with energy flowing directly from the sun; solar through sunlight and wind through the sun’s heating of different parts of the atmosphere, which is the main cause of wind.</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>The top five countries ranked by solar energy consumption are Germany, Italy, Spain, Japan, and China. The percentage of each country’s electricity that comes from solar energy is, respectively: 4.5 percent, 6.3 percent, 4.0 percent, .09 percent, and .6 percent.12</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>certain fundamental problems with solar and wind mean that the more energy they attempt to produce, the more of a problem they create.</p>

<p>the diluteness problem and the intermittency problem</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>As we saw in the Gambian hospital, it is of life and death importance that energy be reliable</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>But taking a look at Germany’s official energy statistics tells a very different story</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>What they are referring to is the fact that because solar and wind are so variable, at any given moment solar can generate 50 percent of the electricity being used. It can also generate 0 percent of the electricity generated at any given moment</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>may generate less than 5 percent of needed electricity.21 What happens then? Reliable sources of energy, in Germany’s case coal, have to produce more electricity. For various technical reasons, this is even more inefficient than it sounds</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>In practice they often have so much excess that they have to pay other countries to take their electricity—which requires the other countries to inefficiently decelerate their reliable power plants to accommodate the influx<br>
HAHAHAHA wtf!!! This is the DUMBEST thing ever! Germany have literally invested into a shit show.</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>the reliable sources have to move up and down quickly to adjust to the whims of the sunlight and wind, they become inefficient—just like your car in stop-and-go-traffic—which means more energy use and incidentally more emissions</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>And what about when there’s a particularly large amount of sunlight or wind? For an electric grid, too much electricity will cause a blackout just as too little will—so then Germany has to shut down its coal plants and be ready to start them up again</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>This is obviously not scalable; if everyone’s electrical generation was as unreliable as Germany’s, there would be no one to absorb their peaks</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>The only way for solar and wind to be truly useful, reliable sources of energy would be to combine them with some form of extremely inexpensive mass-storage system. No such mass-storage system exists, because storing energy in a compact space itself takes a lot of resources</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>It’s more accurate to say that solar and wind are parasites that require a host.</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>Imagine you have a company of highly productive, efficient, reliable workers. Then there is an initiative to bring in “renewable” workers, who will supposedly live forever, but they are expensive and you don’t know when they’ll show up. A document produced by them is not as valuable as a document produced by someone else—because you don’t know when theirs will arrive</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>Energy is a life and death issue—it is not one where we can afford to be sloppy in our thinking and seize upon statistics that seem to confirm our worldview.</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>It is deeply irresponsible and disturbing that environmental leaders are telling us to deprive ourselves of fossil fuels on the promise of what can charitably be described as a highly speculative experiment, and can less charitably be described as an ill-conceived, resource-wasting, perennial failure</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>

<p>Biomass energy is not providing scalable energy, but it is making it difficult for farmers to provide scalable food</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>There is zero evidence that solar, wind, and biomass energy can meaningfully supplement fossil fuel energy, let alone replace it, let alone provide the energy growth that is desperately needed</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>To be sure, solar, wind, and biomass may have their utility for niche uses of energy. If you’re living off the grid and can afford it, an installation with a battery that can power a few appliances might be better than the alternative (no energy, or frequently returning to civilization for diesel fuel)</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>And yet our leaders propose massive bans on fossil fuels with the promise that these radically inferior technologies will be replacements. That reflects an ignorance of, or indifference to, the need for efficient energy</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>One lesson of the failure of renewables is that renewable is not a useful criterion for a good energy source. It says only that one of the inputs is derived from the sun; it says nothing about how long the other inputs will last, and, most important, it says nothing about whether the technology can generate energy that is cheap, plentiful, and reliable</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>

<p>The United States has maintained a fairly constant hydropower consumption because we’ve run out of rivers to dam (which is unfortunate, because hydropower lasts for decades; the Hoover Dam was built in the 1930s).</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>Environmental activists have spent decades shutting down as many hydroelectric dams as possible, particularly large hydroelectric dams, despite hydro’s proven track record as a cheap, reliable source of CO2-free power, in the name of protecting species of fish, free-flowing rivers, and other justifications that focus on nonhuman nature.30</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>If the standard is improving human life, those who believe that catastrophic climate change is coming unless we reduce CO2 emissions should favor damming every possible river to generate reliable CO2-free power.</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>the concentration of energy in uranium is more than a million times that of oil and 2 million times that of coal—although given current technology, in practice it “only” delivers thousands of times more energy per unit of input.32<br>
Woah. Holy guck. That means that with possible innovations in the future there is still vast vast vast quantities of nuclear power left untapped.</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>If natural concentration is a benefit, there is no more naturally concentrated energy source than the uranium or other radioactive metals used to generate nuclear power</p>

2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>Unfortunately, radioactivity is commonly viewed as deadly as such,</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>Nuclear power uses uranium, which exists in enormous quantities around the world, and can also use thorium, an even more abundant material</p>

<p>below a certain threshold, radioactivity is not harmful; we ourselves are radioactive and emit radioactivity</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>critics of nuclear power can cite amounts of radiation coming from, for example, the Fukushima accident, and it sounds scary—even though the amount is not enough for anyone to die now (of radiation poisoning) or in the future (from cancer).</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>In the free world, nuclear power in its entire commercial history has not led to a single death—including from much-publicized failures at Three Mile Island and Fukushima.33</p>

<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>Nuclear power is radioactive, they say—not mentioning that so is the sun and that taking a walk, let alone an airplane ride, exposes you to far more radioactivity than does living next to a nuclear power plant.34</p>

<p>What we do know is that, besides fossil fuel energy, it is by far the most scalable form of energy in the world</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
2. THE ENERGY CHALLENGE:</p>
<p>it means that the nuclear industry has become an essentially government-controlled industry—which, like many a government-controlled industry, has higher prices than others</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
3. THE GREATEST ENERGY TECHNOLOGY OF ALL TIME</p>
<p>Fossil fuels are so called because they are (in most theories) high-energy concentrations of ancient dead plants</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
3. THE GREATEST ENERGY TECHNOLOGY OF ALL TIME</p>
<p>When you burn gasoline in your car or coal in a power plant or gas to heat your home, those bonds break apart, releasing enormous amounts of energy</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
3. THE GREATEST ENERGY TECHNOLOGY OF ALL TIME</p>
<p>If you’ve ever used charcoal instead of wood to grill food, you grasp the basic advantage of using ancient dead plant fuel. The charcoal can generate more heat in less space because it has been “cooked”—primarily, the water has been taken out of it, producing a higher concentration of energy (“burning” water doesn’t release much energy).1</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
3. THE GREATEST ENERGY TECHNOLOGY OF ALL TIME</p>
<p>The other advantage they have is that they exist in astonishingly, astonishingly large quantities. For example, the world has an estimated 3,050 years (at current usage rates) of “total remaining recoverable reserves” of coal.2<br>

3. THE GREATEST ENERGY TECHNOLOGY OF ALL TIME</p>
<p>Coal is the world’s leading fuel for electricity—producing 41 percent of the world’s electricity in 2011—and is expected to become the leading source of energy overall.3</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
3. THE GREATEST ENERGY TECHNOLOGY OF ALL TIME</p>
<p>as electricity consumption increases, infant mortality rate decreases rapidly and access to improved drinking water sources increases.5</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
3. THE GREATEST ENERGY TECHNOLOGY OF ALL TIME</p>
<p>But in the future, it might be worth it—which means that claims that we’ll “run out of oil” are misguided, as coal and gas can effectively produce oil if needed</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
3. THE GREATEST ENERGY TECHNOLOGY OF ALL TIME</p>
<p>For example, coal can be transformed into liquid fuel; the South African energy company SASOL says it can be done for less than eighty dollars per barrel.7 Coal can also be transformed into methanol—methyl alcohol, an alcohol that like ethanol can come from plants but can also come from coal and gas</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
3. THE GREATEST ENERGY TECHNOLOGY OF ALL TIME</p>
<p>The bottom line: If people are free to use it and the industry is free to produce it, coal energy will provide billions with cheap, plentiful, reliable energy for decades to come</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
3. THE GREATEST ENERGY TECHNOLOGY OF ALL TIME</p>
<p>There is a minimum amount of electricity use that will almost always be needed, called base-load power. Above that, we need a technology that can quickly adjust to changes in electricity needs—such as powering a lot of air conditioners on a hot summer day so that we can be comfortable and avoid heatstroke. This is called peak load electricity, and it is natural gas’s specialty. (Coal, nuclear, and hydro specialize in base-load power.</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
3. THE GREATEST ENERGY TECHNOLOGY OF ALL TIME</p>
<p>while oil and coal can be moved relatively easily around the world, gas has long been a local market. This causes supply security issues in which one country is dependent on an unreliable country for gas supplies—the case with many European countries that depend on gas from Russia.</p>

<p>22 February 2019<br>
3. THE GREATEST ENERGY TECHNOLOGY OF ALL TIME</p>
<p>My answer is no. Because oil—or coal, or natural gas, or uranium, or aluminum for that matter—is not naturally a resource</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>

<p>Before the 1850s, oil was not a resource—it was naturally useless. It was a distinct raw material, to be sure, with the potential to become valuable, just as sand has the potential to become a microchip</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
3. THE GREATEST ENERGY TECHNOLOGY OF ALL TIME</p>
<p>But oil had very little use; in fact, in many cases, it was a nuisance. Drillers seeking underground saltwater deposits to distill into salt were annoyed by the presence of this “rock oil.”14</p>

<p>The amount of crops we can grow today is an utterly “unnatural” phenomenon—that is, it is way beyond the natural capacity of the nutrients in land to nourish crops in one season, let alone season after season. One solution to the problem of fertilizing was manure or some other organic fertilizer, which increased the amount of nitrogen plants could absorb and thus the amount of them that could grow</p>

<p>the achievements of Norman Borlaug and other great food scientists, often called the green revolution (not related to the modern Green movement), were possible only because of the time created by fossil-fueled civilization to engage in intensive research, because high-powered machines have made it unnecessary for all of us to do physical labor<br>
Yes see I understand this very much I feel. When I engage in things like small acts of kindness, or local community, that at times feels like a gargantuan waste of time because that free time could be spent researching, which could lead to technological breakthroughs a million fold more useful to humanity than a small act of kindness.

<p>for now I’ll just observe that the natural environment is not naturally a healthy, safe place; that’s why human beings historically had a life expectancy of thirty. Absent<br>
Hmm. Lierre Keith talks about the myth of progress. It *is* true however that human life expectancy was 30. This didn’t mean people didn’t grow to 60,70 etc. It was 30 because of the extraordinarily high infant mortality rate. Most newborns did not survive. And with regards to free time.. it’s not just about time to do things. Today we have the possibility of designing a lifestyle and business that gives us 100% free time *and* we have machine calories with 90+ people behind us. It’s an incredible progress.

<p>How does fossil fuel use affect climate livability? When we burn fossil fuels, what are all the climate-related risks and all the benefits that result</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
4. THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT AND THE FERTILIZER EFFECT</p>
<p>CO2 affects climate in at least two ways: as a greenhouse gas with a warming impact, but also as plant food with a fertilizing impact (plants are a major part of the climate system as well as a benefit of a livable climate)</p>
<p>22 February 2019<br>
4. THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT AND THE FERTILIZER EFFECT</p>
<p>The second impact of CO2, which is rarely mentioned, is the tendency of cheap, plentiful, reliable energy from fossil fuels to amplify our ability to adapt to climate—to maximize the benefits we get from good weather and ample rainfall and minimize the risks from heat waves, cold snaps, and droughts</p>

<p>United States has had zero deaths from drought in the last eight years. This doesn’t mean there are actually zero, as the database only covers incidents involving ten or more deaths, but it means pretty near zero. Historically, drought is the number-one climate-related cause of death.</p>

5. THE ENERGY EFFECT AND CLIMATE MASTERY</p>
<p>Worldwide it has gone down by 99.98 percent in the last eighty years for many energy-related reasons: oil-powered drought-relief convoys, more food in general because of more prolific, fossil fuel–based agriculture, and irrigation systems.6</p>

<p>And yet we constantly hear reports that fossil fuels are making droughts worse</p>

<p>Climate is no longer a major cause of death, thanks in large part to fossil fuels.8 By contrast, there are 1.3 billion people with no electricity, the vast majority of whom will die early deaths, a problem that can be solved only by using more fossil fuels.</p>

5. THE ENERGY EFFECT AND CLIMATE MASTERY</p>
<p>The sophisticated version of the idea that our climate is naturally safe or ideal says that because man has flourished in the current climatological period, the 10,000-year post–Ice Age stretch known as the Holocene, that is the only global climate we can live in and if there’s a risk that fossil fuels will break the “natural” temperature highs of that last 10,000 years, we need to stop using them.</p>

<p>More accurately, the Netherlands experienced a sinking of the land, rather than a rise of sea level, but the effect was essentially the same—50 percent of the Netherlands lies less than three feet above sea level, and roughly 20 percent of its people actually live at an elevation below sea level.14</p>

<p>At a certain point, it became obvious that floods were becoming a large problem because the water in these lowlands had nowhere to drain. Strangely (or perhaps not), this situation did not turn the residents of the Netherlands into helpless refugees but spurred them to find solutions.</p>

<p>But even once human beings came on the scene, with their fantastic brains, they couldn’t choose their climate very easily because of lack of mobility.

5. THE ENERGY EFFECT AND CLIMATE MASTERY</p>
<p>If you think of climate in a real way, not as some vague, mystical, “global climate” but as the climate around you, you are a master of climate just by virtue of the fact that you can change climates.</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
5. THE ENERGY EFFECT AND CLIMATE MASTERY</p>
<p>but climate changes, even in the worst scenarios proposed by the most alarmist of the failed models, occur over periods of fifty to a hundred years. As with everything else in life, if we need to enhance our ability to do something—such as move—we need to be doubling down on energy production, not restricting it.</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
5. THE ENERGY EFFECT AND CLIMATE MASTERY</p>
<p>Again, mass movement with regard to climate changes seems very unlikely, but it’s still worth mentioning because mobility is desirable, period, for the sake of the pursuit of happiness and because someday, some future generation is going to be faced with a dramatic climate change, and they’ll need the energy and mobility to cope with it.</p>

<p>One would be an embrace of technological solutions,</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
5. THE ENERGY EFFECT AND CLIMATE MASTERY</p>
<p>Another would be investing a huge amount of energy and technology looking for still better solutions.</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
5. THE ENERGY EFFECT AND CLIMATE MASTERY</p>
<p>Economically, we would want a commitment to liberate any and every technology that could help, from seawall technology to dike technology to durable building technology to CO2-free energy technology. We would not oppose the only globally scalable form of CO2-free energy ever invented: nuclear power</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>

<p>the evidence is clear that nuclear is the safest energy technology (safer than fossil fuels, hydro, wind, solar).19</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
5. THE ENERGY EFFECT AND CLIMATE MASTERY</p>
<p>The one thing a human-focused response to a major climate danger would not do is try to save ourselves by pursuing solar, wind, and biofuels. These are the worst-performing sources of energy we have, and if we were truly in desperate straits, we would go with something that works; we wouldn’t force everyone to use the worst and hope for the best.</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
5. THE ENERGY EFFECT AND CLIMATE MASTERY</p>
<p>I think that a proper reaction to a major danger from fossil fuels would be sorrow. Think about it: If the energy that runs our civilization has a tragic flaw, that is a terribly sad thing. It would be even worse, say, than if wireless technology caused brain cancer. The appropriate attitude would be gratitude toward the fossil fuel companies for what they had done for us, combined with recognition that we would have to suffer a lot in the years ahead, combined with the commitment to the best technologies that I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
5. THE ENERGY EFFECT AND CLIMATE MASTERY</p>
<p>I believe that we owe the fossil fuel industry an apology. While the industry has been producing the energy to make our climate more livable, we have treated it as a villain. We owe it the kind of gratitude that we owe anyone who makes our lives much, much better.</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
5. THE ENERGY EFFECT AND CLIMATE MASTERY</p>
<p>We know that the way to make climate livable is not to try to refrain from affecting it but to use cheap energy to technologically master it. Thus, if the undeveloped world is having trouble dealing with climate, it’s not because of our .01 percent change in the atmosphere; it’s because they haven’t followed the examples of China, India, and others who have increased fossil fuels use by hundreds of percent.22</p>

<p>There is a group of people who are working every day to make sure that the machines that can make us safe from our naturally dangerous climate and enable us to thrive in it have all the energy they need. These people work in coal mines, on oil rigs, in laboratories, in boardrooms, all devoted to figuring out how to produce plentiful, reliable energy at prices you can afford—because that is what their well-being depends on and, in my experience, because they believe that it is the right thing to do.</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
5. THE ENERGY EFFECT AND CLIMATE MASTERY</p>
<p>Those are the people in the fossil fuel industry, who are dehumanized in the media on a daily basis, who are tarred as Big Oil or, in the case of workers, such as coal miners, are portrayed as dupes who don’t know what they’re doing, who aren’t wise enough to know they’re making our climate unlivable through the work that supports themselves and their families.</p>

<p>Discussions of “mercury poisoning” are misleading, because mercury becomes methylmercury only under certain conditions, and methylmercury can be absorbed by human beings in relevant quantities only under certain conditions (for example, the element selenium seems to prevent the absorption of methylmercury).18</p>

<p>A poison or pollutant is always a combination of substance and dose. If someone mentions just a substance to scare you, independent of the context or the dose, he has given you meaningless, misleading information</p>

7. REDUCING RISKS AND SIDE EFFECTS</p>
<p>While man-made things can be bad, it is perverse to single out the man-made as bad per se. To be against the man-made as such is to have a bias against the mind-made, which is to be against the human mind, whose very purpose is to figure out how to transform our environment to meet our needs</p>

7. REDUCING RISKS AND SIDE EFFECTS</p>
<p>The only way fossil fuels are a net minus for “the environment” is if by “the environment” you mean our surroundings not from our perspective, but from a nonhuman perspective. From the perspective of organisms we need to kill or use to survive, such as the parasite, the malarial mosquito, the dangerous animal, or the trees we clear to build a road, we are a negative for the environment.</p>

<p>It’s valuable to think of the ability to enjoy nature as a resource, something that we potentially have but don’t automatically have. If we think that way, we see that like any resource, it is expanded by energy</p>

<p>Just as we are taught to think of nature as safe and clean, so we are taught to think of it as scenic. But it becomes scenic to us only if we have access to a variety of beautiful scenes</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
7. REDUCING RISKS AND SIDE EFFECTS</p>
<p>There are more such scenes, but for most of history, no one got to enjoy many of them because they lacked the ultimate tool for enjoying nature—mobility</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>

<p>Fossil fuel energy gives us the mobility to get to it, the adaptability to be safe in it, and the time to enjoy it</p>

7. REDUCING RISKS AND SIDE EFFECTS</p>
<p>When we talk about resources, we have to remember that the only resource that can’t be re-created, the real resource to guard jealously, is time—it is irreplaceable and unrepeatable</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
7. REDUCING RISKS AND SIDE EFFECTS</p>
<p>Furthermore, because fossil fuel energy is so dense and requires very little land and no live plants, it gives us both the wealth and the physical ability to preserve pretty much any piece of nature we want</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
7. REDUCING RISKS AND SIDE EFFECTS</p>
<p>Whether to actively preserve a species or not should be made with reference to a human standard of value. Much of the ecology field holds to the nonimpact standard, which treats another species’ extinction as intrinsically wrong<br>
Hmmm</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
7. REDUCING RISKS AND SIDE EFFECTS</p>
<p>That can be the removal of a direct threat, such as making bears nonexistent where our kids go to school, or the preservation of species that we want to survive, such as the panda, even if we do not strictly need it for our own survival.<br>
If we are not anthropocentric, then what are we using as our centre, our view? This seems like a hugely anthropocentric view, but what would be a different view? And what would the consequences be of that view? We don’t kill the bears because we are bear-centric, so then those bears end up killing our children.. then what?</p>

8. FOSSIL FUELS, SUSTAINABILITY, AND THE FUTURE</p>
<p>With so much consuming, can this way of life really last? Is it sustainable? The answer is better than yes. Not only can our way of life last; it can keep getting better and better, as long as we don’t adopt “sustainability” policies</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
8. FOSSIL FUELS, SUSTAINABILITY, AND THE FUTURE</p>
<p>using fossil fuels is unsustainable because we’ll run out of them. Instead, we keep running into them. The more we use, the more we create. Fossil fuel energy resources, we discussed, are created—by turning a nonresource raw material into a resource using human ingenuity<br>
Yes this is a key point. The statement “Earth has finite resources” is false precisely because the resources we use do not come from Earth. Rather they come from the human mind.</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
8. FOSSIL FUELS, SUSTAINABILITY, AND THE FUTURE</p>
<p>What are the long-term prospects for this way of life? While today we are rich in fossil fuel resources and the wealth they help us create, what is in store for the future?</p>

8. FOSSIL FUELS, SUSTAINABILITY, AND THE FUTURE</p>
<p>In chapter 3, we saw that the amount of unused fossil fuel raw material currently in the Earth exceeds by far the amount we’ve used in the entire history of civilization by many multiples and that the key issue is whether we have the technological ability and economic reason to turn that raw material into a resource</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
8. FOSSIL FUELS, SUSTAINABILITY, AND THE FUTURE</p>
<p>The theory behind these predictions is that Earth has a finite “carrying capacity,” an idea that was spread far and wide in the 1970s. Two of the leading exponents</p>

8. FOSSIL FUELS, SUSTAINABILITY, AND THE FUTURE</p>
<p>When a population of organisms grows in a finite environment, sooner or later it will encounter a resource limit. This phenomenon, described by ecologists as reaching the “carrying capacity” of the environment, applies to bacteria on a culture dish, to fruit flies in a jar of agar, and to buffalo on a prairie. It must also apply to man on this finite planet<br>
I believe the difference here is that flies bacteria or buffalo do not have the brain power to transform their environment and thus create resources.</p>

<p>McKibben’s article was a sensation. It received 120,000 “Likes” on Facebook—which an exultant Center for American Progress blogger described as “monster social media numbers of the kind usually reserved for pieces on HuffPost about Kim Kardashian in a bikini.”3</p>

9. WINNING THE FUTURE</p>
<p>lack of response was, I believed, because McKibben was making a moral argument—that it was time to do the right thing about fossil fuels for our future, even if it was difficult.

<p>as you read this, there is a real, live, committed movement against fossil fuels that truly wants to deprive us of the energy of life. That movement is named the Green movement. To understand how to defend fossil fuels, we must understand the attack, who is attacking, why, and how</p>

<p>In one sense, the answer to “Why do we believe the wrong thing about fossil fuels?” is simple. Lack of education</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
9. WINNING THE FUTURE</p>
<p>The reason we have come to oppose fossil fuels and not see their virtues is not primarily because of a lack of factual knowledge, but because of the presence of irrational moral prejudice in our leaders and, to a degree, in our entire culture</p>

<p>24 February 2019<br>
9. WINNING THE FUTURE</p>
<p>The prejudice, which is held consistently by our environmental thought leaders and inconsistently by the culture at large is the idea that nonimpact on nature is the standard of value. It is better known by a single color: Green.</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
9. WINNING THE FUTURE</p>
<p>We’ve seen that these thought leaders not only come to certain deadly conclusions and policies, but also keep using the same faulty method of thinking: they exaggerate the negatives of fossil fuels and ignore or greatly understate the positives</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
9. WINNING THE FUTURE</p>
<p>The environmental thought leaders’ opposition to fossil fuels is not a mistaken attempt at pursuing human life as their standard of value. They are too smart and knowledgeable to make such a mistake. Their opposition is a consistent attempt at pursuing their actual standard of value: a pristine environment, unaltered nature.</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
9. WINNING THE FUTURE</p>
<p>If an unaltered, untransformed environment is our standard of value, then nothing could be worse than cheap, plentiful, reliable energy.</p>

<p>I’m saying that if fossil fuels created no waste, including no CO2, if they were even cheaper, if they would last practically forever, if there were no resource-depletion concerns, the Green movement would still oppose them</p>

9. WINNING THE FUTURE</p>
<p>Fusion is what the sun uses for energy. But all human attempts at fusion so far have been inefficient—they take in more energy than they produce.

<p>24 February 2019<br>
9. WINNING THE FUTURE</p>
<p>That is what Amory Lovins regards as disastrous “because of what we might do with it.”16 Well, we’ve seen what we do with energy—we make our lives amazing</p>

9. WINNING THE FUTURE</p>
<p>But if your standard of value is unaltered nature, then Lovins is right to worry. With more energy, we have the ability to alter nature more, and we will do so—because transforming our environment, transforming nature, is our means of survival and flourishing</p>

Yes.. I remember having an uncomfortable feeling about this overpopulation thing.. it just didn’t seem it would end well.</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
9. WINNING THE FUTURE</p>
<p>This is the logical end of holding human nonimpact as your standard of value; the best way to achieve it is to do nothing at all, to not exist</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
9. WINNING THE FUTURE</p>
<p>our culture has accepted this toxic standard in large doses under the friendly label “Green.</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
9. WINNING THE FUTURE</p>
<p>How many of us consider the possibility that human beings could be a positive force climatewise, whether by fertilizing the atmosphere or by creating an environment that maximizes climate benefits and minimizes climate risks?</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
9. WINNING THE FUTURE</p>
<p>How many of us consider the possibility that we are improving our environment by using fossil fuels? In my experience, not even the fossil fuel industry considers that possibility.</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
9. WINNING THE FUTURE</p>
<p>It is considered Green to object to crucial industrial projects, from power plants to dams to apartment complexes, on the grounds that some plant or animal will be affected, plants and animals that take precedence over the human animals who need or want the projects</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
9. WINNING THE FUTURE</p>
<p>It is considered Green to do less of anything industrial, from driving to flying to using a washing machine to using disposable diapers to consuming pretty much any modern product</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
9. WINNING THE FUTURE</p>
<p>The essence of “going Green,” the common denominator in all its various iterations, is the belief that humans should minimize their impact on nonhuman nature<br>
In a way the life I am leading and have led is all green. It’s all about non-impact. Hence Do Nothing meditations hahaha.</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
9. WINNING THE FUTURE</p>
<p>But this attempt to balance being on a human standard of value sometimes and a nonhuman standard at other times is like trying to create a balanced diet that includes food and poison.</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
9. WINNING THE FUTURE</p>
<p>In large part, we do so because environmental leaders have made us associate the antihuman ideal of nonimpact with something very good: minimizing pollution, that is, minimizing negative environmental impacts</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
9. WINNING THE FUTURE</p>
<p>Another reason we buy into Green is because we as a culture have never been fully comfortable with human industry. We’re taught that the pursuit of profit is wrong, that capitalism is wrong, and that we should feel guilty for our wealth and way of life<br>
It’s that whole original sin thing again no? We don’t deserve this!</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
9. WINNING THE FUTURE</p>
<p>That’s the power of prejudice—prejudice that comes from holding a false philosophy we don’t know we accept and that most of us would fully reject if we saw its real meaning<br>
This epitomises me and my view. I am very glad to have found and read this book. This is incredibly important work.</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
9. WINNING THE FUTURE</p>
<p>So long as we accept nonimpact as an environmental ideal, we will not fight passionately against those who oppose the energy of life, because we won’t consider its essence—the transformation of nature in service of human life—as a moral ideal<br>
I wonder if there is a middle way.. the transformation or non-transformation of nature in service to *all* life, and not just humans, but also not just animals/wildlife?</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
9. WINNING THE FUTURE</p>
<p>We don’t want to “save the planet” from human beings; we want to improve the planet for human beings.</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
9. WINNING THE FUTURE</p>
<p>We need to say that human life is our one and only standard of value. And we need to say that the transformation of our environment, the essence of our survival, is a supreme virtue. We need to recognize that to the extent we deny either, we are willing to harm real, flesh-and-blood human beings for some antihuman dogma<br>
This latter part is the core of it. But surely there is a middle way? For example roads with underground passages so wildlife can cross safely. Or efforts to relocate animals that will be displaced by development of dams etc, much like we would relocate villages or towns if they would be flooded by a new dam.</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
9. WINNING THE FUTURE</p>
<p>Making a moral case always means naming your standard—for us, human life<br>
There is 100% a middle way. My moral standard: all life. But by choosing that – does that open me up to wanting to kill human beings? I don’t think so – human beings are part of all life. So development can and should be done for the benefit of human beings, but it must also bring awareness to the other species with which we share this world. There 100% are ways we can continue developing while being mindful of wildlife and nature.</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
9. WINNING THE FUTURE</p>
<p>The fossil fuel industry is a moral industry at its core.</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
9. WINNING THE FUTURE</p>
<p>You might say that it’s offensive to compare the fossil fuel industry to the tobacco industry—and you’d be right. But in the battle for hearts and minds, you are widely viewed as worse than the tobacco industry.</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
9. WINNING THE FUTURE</p>
<p>Historically, it has been a major bankroller of Green organizations. For example, between 2007 and 2010, the natural gas industry gave $25 million to the Sierra Club.19<br>
Hahahhaha wtf??</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
9. WINNING THE FUTURE</p>
<p>Because I am a capitalist and charge for my services, maybe I will get attacked now for being paid by the fossil fuel industry. But there’s the prejudice again. Why would someone assume that someone who works with fossil fuel companies is corrupt, while those who, say, accept government grants aren’t</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
9. WINNING THE FUTURE</p>
<p>I don’t say this industry is good because I work with it; I work with this industry because I think it’s good.</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
9. WINNING THE FUTURE</p>
<p>I wrote this book for anyone who wants to make the world a better place—for human beings—including many, many people who would start this book opposed to or at least suspicious of fossil fuels</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
9. WINNING THE FUTURE</p>
<p>The idea of ruining the world for the less fortunate and, even worse, for our children or grandchildren is horrifying to us. Thus, when someone tells us of a major risk that our behavior is causing, we want to do something about it</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
9. WINNING THE FUTURE</p>
<p>What we are not taught is that the biggest risk is not using fossil fuels, and that using them is incredibly virtuous.</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
9. WINNING THE FUTURE</p>
<p>We’re not taught that some people truly believe that human life doesn’t matter, and that their goal is not to help us triumph over nature’s obstacles but to remove us as an obstacle to the rest of nature</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
9. WINNING THE FUTURE</p>
<p>they prioritize nature over you</p>
<p>24 February 2019<br>
9. WINNING THE FUTURE</p>
<p>Mankind’s use of fossil fuels is supremely virtuous—because human life is the standard of value, and because using fossil fuels transforms our environment to make it wonderful for human life.</p>

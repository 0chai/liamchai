		<h2>The Attention Revolution by B. Alan Wallace</h2>

					
		<div class="post">

			<p>This book has been a manual for me on several solitary retreats now. Using the stages as a map I find very useful. Compared to Culadasa’s The Mind Illuminated this book is less detailed, but I find that makes it easier to work with. The instructions for knowing which stage you are on are very clear and simple. It’s hard to mistake.</p>
<p>The full achievement of shamatha is detailed in this book. A good companion is Gen Lamrimpa’s book, How to Practice Shamatha Meditation TK.</p>
<p>One thing to note is that Alan Wallace uses a benchmark for achieving shamatha that I have not seen others use within the Buddhist community. He cites his sources and they are excellent, so what he says I do not doubt. But I do find it strange that no one else seems to say the same things.</p>
<p>Anyway, these are my highlights below. I would recommend buying a physical copy of the book as it’ll be a manual to constantly refer to if you are on retreat and off from technology.</p>
<h3><span id="The_Attention_Revolution_by_B_Alan_Wallace"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Attention-Revolution-Unlocking-Power-Focused/dp/0861712765/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Attention Revolution</a> by B. Alan Wallace</span></h3>

Some modern teachers of Theravada Buddhism claim that only “momentary shamatha” is needed for insight meditation, implying that sustained, focused attention is unnecessary.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 174<br>
Tibetan Buddhism, on the other hand, does provide detailed instructions for achieving focused attention. Thus is it is all the more perplexing that among Tibetan Buddhist meditators today, both inside and outside Tibet, very few devote themselves to sustained shamatha practice.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 176<br>
Hardly anyone heeds the counsel of the great meditators of Tibet’s past, who claim that the achievement of shamatha is necessary for all advanced forms of meditation to be fully effective.</p>
<p>Highlight(blue) – Location 264<br>
But they don’t cure anything. They merely suppress symptoms while generating harmful side effects, and even if you don’t become addicted, you may develop a psychic dependence on them—perhaps</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 277<br>
Each of us chooses, by our ways of attending to things, the universe we inhabit and the people we encounter. But for most of us, this “choice” is unconscious, so it’s not really a choice at all.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 281<br>
The reality that appears to us is not so much what’s out there as it is those aspects of the world we have focused on.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 288<br>
I suggest that if you were able to focus your attention at will, you could actually choose the uni-verse you appear to inhabit.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 315<br>
James recognized the enormous significance of the ability to voluntarily sustain one’s attention on a chosen topic, declaring that an education that could effectively improve this faculty would be the education par excellence. 3 But he was at a loss when it came to providing practical directions for achieving this goal.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 320<br>
Can the mind be irreversibly freed from its emotional afflictions, such as craving, hostility, depression, envy, and pride? Are there limits to our love and compassion?</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 351<br>
literature—the ten stages described by the eighth-century Indian Buddhist contemplative Kamalashila in his classic work Stages of Meditation.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 354<br>
Flashes of insight are valuable, but after the fleeting bliss of such meditative experiences, the dirty laundry of the mind still awaits cleaning.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 355<br>
For that, contemplative insight must be supported by a high degree of attentional balance, and this requires systematic training.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 364<br>
One progresses through each stage by rooting out progressively more subtle forms of the two obsta-cles: mental agitation and dullness.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 369<br>
For the first four stages, you should practice whatever method you find easiest. By stage five, the mind is relatively stable, and you can move on to subtler techniques. For achieving the first four stages, I recommend the practice of mind-fulness of breathing,</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 375<br>
Beginning with the fifth stage, I recommend a method called settling the mind in its natural state. In this technique, you direct your attention to mental experiences, all the events—thoughts, mental images, and emotions—that arise in the domain of the mind. This method is drawn from the Dzogchen, or “Great Perfection” lineage, but is found in other Buddhist traditions as well.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 379<br>
With the instructions for the eighth attentional stage onward, we move on to the still subtler practice of maintaining awareness of awareness itself. The technique is called shamatha without an object. Here the practice is not so much one of developing attentional stability and vividness as it is of discovering the stillness and luminosity inherent in awareness itself.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 386<br>
You may use any one of the three methods to progress along all ten stages of attentional development, or you may follow the sequence described in this book.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 424<br>
According to Tibetan oral tradition, among meditators who are well qual-ified to embark on this discipline, those of sharpest faculties may be able to achieve all ten stages within three months; those with “medium“ faculties may take six months; and those with “dull“ faculties may require nine months.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 433<br>
This level of professional training may seem daunting and unfeasible to most readers of this book, but compare it to the training of Olympic ath-letes. Only a small number of individuals have the time, ability, and incli-nation to devote themselves to such training, which can appear at first glance to have little relevance for the diverse practical problems facing humanity today. But research on serious athletes has yielded many valu-able insights concerning diet, exercise, and human motivation that are rel-evant to the general public. While the training of Olympic athletes is focused primarily on achieving physical excellence, this attentional train-ing is concerned with achieving optimal levels of attentional performance.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 458<br>
Mindfulness in this context differs somewhat from the way some contemporary meditation teachers present it. Vipassana teachers, for instance, commonly explain mindfulness as a moment-to-moment, nonjudgmental awareness of what-ever arises. In the context of shamatha, however, mindfulness refers to attending continuously to a familiar object, without forgetfulness or distraction.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 480<br>
Hyperactivity is characterized by excitation, agitation, and distraction, while an attention deficit is characterized by laxity, dullness, and lethargy.</p>
<p>Highlight(orange) – Location 533<br>
Now bring your awareness to the tac-tile sensations throughout your body, from the soles of your feet up to the crown of your head. Note the sensations in your shoulders and neck, and if you detect any tightness there, release it. Likewise, be aware of the mus-cles of your face—your jaws, temples, and forehead, as well as your eyes—and soften any area that feels constricted. Let your face relax like that of a sleeping baby, and set your entire body at ease.<br>
Note – Location 538<br>
Full body relaxation FIRST.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 553<br>
Be at ease. Be still. Be vigilant. These three qualities of the body are to be maintained throughout all meditation sessions.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 589<br>
This is a “field approach” to training the attention. Instead of pinpoint-ing the attention on a mental image, a prayer, a mantra, or a specific region of the body, open your awareness to the entire field of sensations through-out the body, especially those related to respiration.</p>
<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 620<br>
We are all aware of the way the body heals itself. Physicians don’t heal abrasions, and surgeons don’t mend bone fractures. Instead, they do what-ever they can to allow the body to heal itself—by keeping the wound clean, setting the broken bone, and so on. These are so common that it’s easy to lose sight of the extraordinary nature of the body’s own healing power.</p>
<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 625<br>
We have to start by assuming the body knows how to breathe better than the mind does.</p>

To flourish individually, we must consider the well-being of those around us. As the Buddha declared, “One who loves himself will never harm another.”8</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 721<br>
Buddhism, misguided desires are called craving, which here means an attrac-tion for something whose desirable qualities we exaggerate while ignoring any undesirable qualities.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 733<br>
we are betting our lives that we can find the happiness we seek by chasing fleeting pleasures. Psychologists have called this the hedonic treadmill,</p>

coarse excitation, which we typically encounter during the initial stages of attentional training. The second two levels of excitation, medium excitation and subtle excitation,</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 804<br>
When you can occasionally maintain continuity of awareness of bodily sensations for about a minute, you have reached the second stage.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 808<br>
If you are a seasoned meditator, you have probably found that involuntary, internal commentary on your practice can be an obstacle. Even the ongoing thought, “Here is the in-breath…Here is the out-breath…” can be an intrusion. However, inter-nal commentary can also be useful, especially in the first two stages of shamatha</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 853<br>
Meditation is a balancing act between attention and relaxation.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 876<br>
One way to cultivate attentional stability is to direct our attention down-ward to the sensations in the abdomen</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 877<br>
Mindfulness of the entire body is very helpful for relaxing the mind, but this technique of focusing on the abdomen, which is commonly taught in the Burmese Theravada tradition, can be especially helpful for stabiliz-ing the mind.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 898<br>
the word ana-panasati, which is usually translated as “mindfulness of breathing,” as “mindfulness with breathing.”16 What we attend to in this practice is the field of tactile sensations; what we attend with is the breathing.</p>

<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 930<br>
Even in the midst of work, we can take off fifteen seconds here and sixty seconds there to balance the attention by quietly focusing on the breath.</p>

“In the seen there is only the seen; in the heard, there is only the heard; in the sensed, there is only the sensed; in the mentally perceived, there is only the mentally perceived.”17</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 971<br>
According to Buddhist psychology, in any single moment of awareness, which may be as brief as one millisecond, attention is focused in only one sense field.</p>

you may become attached to this state of mind, and that can result in apathetic indifference to those around you and the world at large. You’ve got your own quiet space of serenity, and you may not want to be disturbed.</p>

Whenyoureachthethirdstage, resurgentattention, duringeachprac-tice session your attention is fixed most of the time upon your meditative object. By now, you will have increased the duration of each session beyond the initial twenty-four minutes to perhaps twice that.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1068<br>
As your attention gradually stabilizes, you may increase the duration of each session by increments of three minutes.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1069<br>
At all times, though, value the quality of your meditation over the quantity of time spent in each session.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1070<br>
If you sit for long periods but let your mind rove around unnoticed among distractions or fall into dullness, not only are you wasting your time, but also you are developing bad habits that will only get harder and harder to break.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1080<br>
The third stage is achieved only when your mind remains focused on the object most of the time in virtually all your sessions.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1086<br>
coarse laxity, which occurs when your attention mostly disengages from the object and sinks into a spaced-out vacancy.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1097<br>
While the main force of your awareness is directed to the meditation object with mindfulness, this needs to be supported with the faculty of introspection, which allows for the quality control of attention, enabling you to swiftly note when the mind has fallen into either excitation or laxity.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1101<br>
Your first antidote to excitation is to relax more deeply; to counteract laxity, arouse your attention.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1116<br>
If you are practicing for only a session or two each day, you may not progress beyond the second attentional stage.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1117<br>
The reason for this is simple: if you are balancing your attention for an hour or so each day, but letting it become fragmented and distracted for the other fifteen hours of waking time each day, then the attentional coherence cultivated during these brief sessions is overwhelmed by the distractions of the rest of the day.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1120<br>
The achievement of the stage of resurgent attention requires a greater commit-ment to practice. This will entail multiple sessions of meditation each day, practiced within a quiet, contemplative way of life that supports the culti-vation of inner calm and collectedness.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1123<br>
The key to success is to conduct your life between sessions in such a way that you don’t lose the ground you have gained.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1130<br>
the initial emphasis in shamatha practice is on relaxation, which can be induced by attending to the sensations of breathing throughout the body. The second emphasis is on stability of attention, and for this it can be helpful to observe the sensations of breathing in the region of the belly. Then, having established a foundation of relaxation and stability, we shift the emphasis to cultivating vividness of attention.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1134<br>
It is crucially important that stability is not gained at the expense of relaxation, and that the increase of vividness does not coincide with the decrease of stability. The relationship among these three qualities can be likened to the roots, trunk, and foliage of a tree. As your practice grows, the roots of relaxation go deeper, the trunk of stability gets stronger, and the foliage of vividness reaches higher.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1159<br>
This analogy refers to the healing effect of balanced attention. When awareness is brought to rest on a neutral object, such as the breath, imme-diately every distressing thought disappears, and the mind becomes peace-ful, sublime, and happy. These qualities do not arise from the object of awareness—the breath—but from the nature of the mind in a state of bal-ance. This approach to healing the mind is similar to healing the physical body. The Buddha implied in his rain cloud analogy that the mind, like the body, has an innate power to heal itself.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1186<br>
But as your mind calms down again, the breathing and the sensations that go with it become finer, and this once again challenges you to heighten the degree of vividness.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1192<br>
Especially when you meditate many hours a day, you may experience within your body prana, or vital energies, shifting and releasing pockets of ten-sion. When you engage in mindfulness of breathing, these energies begin to balance and flow naturally. This is a process that takes time, and while the energies redistribute themselves, their movement produces various sen-sations.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1197<br>
practice of shamatha results in an anomalous kind of attention. Nor-mally, when the mind is relaxed, attention is slack, and when attention is aroused, this brings with it a state of tension, a tightening of the body and mind. But in this practice, the more you arouse your attention, the more deeply the mind relaxes.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1207<br>
Always go for qual-ity over quantity. Unbroken continuity of practice is vital.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1208<br>
Imagine starting a fire by rub-bing two sticks together: if you rub the sticks together for only a few moments, then rest, then do it for a few moments, then rest, you could continue in this way for years without even igniting a spark.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1236<br>
Solitary meditation doesn’t cause mental imbalances, but uncovers them.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1239<br>
But this requires courage to face your own inner demons and persist in the practice despite the emo-tional upheavals that are bound to occur in the course of this training.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1241<br>
When I lead shamatha seminars, I like to think of them as “expeditions” rather than “retreats.”</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1247<br>
In the practice of shamatha, we discover how deeply our minds are trapped in the twin ruts of excitation and laxity. In the Buddhist tradition, a mind trapped in these ruts is said to be dysfunctional,</p>

<p>Highlight(blue) – Location 1362<br>
This practice is a direct antidote to feelings of depression, anxiety, and hopelessness that may arise in the course of intensive, sus-tained meditation, or simply in the course of daily living.</p>

close attention. At this point, due to the power of enhanced mindfulness, you no longer completely forget your chosen object, the tactile sensations of the breath at the nostrils.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1388<br>
Each of your sessions may now last an hour or longer, and throughout this time, your attention cannot be involuntarily drawn entirely away from the object.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1390<br>
You are now free of coarse excitation.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1392<br>
At this stage it is said that you achieve the power of mindfulness. 27 In the Indian and Tibetan Mahayana traditions, mindfulness is defined as the mental faculty of maintaining attention, without forgetfulness or distrac-tion, on a familiar object.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1409<br>
The modern Vipassana approach views mindfulness as nondiscriminating, moment-to-moment “bare awareness”; the Indo-Tibetan tradition, however, characterizes mind-fulness as bearing in mind the object of attention, the state of not forget-ting, not being distracted, and not floating.32</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1415<br>
present…If you are remembering your second-grade teacher, that is memory. When you then become aware that you are remembering your second-grade teacher, that is mindfulness.”33</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1447<br>
Mindfulness is cultivated in the practice of shamatha, and it is applied in the practice of contemplative insight</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1457<br>
While your attention is no longer prone to coarse excitation, it is still flawed by a medium degree of excitation and coarse laxity.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1458<br>
When medium excitation occurs, you don’t completely lose track of your object of attention, but involuntary thoughts occupy the center of attention and the meditative object is displaced to the periphery.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1460<br>
To compare this with coarse excitation, let’s again take the analogy of tuning into a radio sta-tion. Coarse excitation is like losing your chosen station altogether, as your tuner slips either to another station or into mere static. Medium excitation is like drifting slightly toward another station but not so completely that you can no longer hear your chosen station at all. You still hear it, but it’s muffled by extraneous noise.</p>

However, to continue all the way along the path of shamatha, eventually you must shift your attention from the tactile sensations of breathing to an “acquired sign” (Pali: uggaha-nimitta), a symbol of the air element that appears before the mind’s eye as you progress in shamatha practice.</p>
<p>Highlight(orange) – Location 1501<br>
As you progress in this practice, increase the duration of your sessions for as long as you are able to maintain a quality of attention rela-tively free of laxity and excitation.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1506<br>
While Buddhaghosa includes certain kinds of tactile sensations among the acquired signs associated with the breath practice, the Indo-Tibetan Mahayana tradition emphasizes that advanced stages along the path to shamatha can be achieved only by focusing on a mental object, not a sensory impression.40</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1508<br>
The reason for this is that the development of shamatha entails the cultiva-tion of an exceptionally high degree of attentional vividness. By focusing on an object of any of the physical senses, you can certainly develop stability,</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1511<br>
but vividness will not be enhanced to its full potential. For this, a mental object is needed. It is commonly pointed out in the Buddhist tradition that shamatha is achieved with mental awareness, not sensory awareness.</p>

At this point, you find that you can take satisfaction in your practice, even though there is still some resistance to it. You have pro-gressed well on this path, and the results of your efforts are apparent to you.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1708<br>
you must now confront another prob-lem that was lurking in the shadows of your mind all along: coarse laxity.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1714<br>
This is a peace-ful state of mind, so the ignorant may mistake it for the attainment of shamatha, which literally means quiescence, tranquillity, and serenity. True shamatha is imbued not only with a degree of stability far beyond that achieved at this stage of attentional practice but also with an extraordinary vividness that one has hardly begun to develop at this point in the training.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1724<br>
The primary challenge here is to overcome laxity without undermining stability. The way to counteract laxity is to arouse the attention, to take a greater interest in the object of meditation. Tibetan contemplatives liken this to stringing a lute. If the strings are too taut, they may easily break under the strain, but if they are too slack, the instrument is unplayable. Likewise, the task at this point is to determine the proper “pitch” of attention. If you arouse the mind too much in your efforts to remedy lax-ity, it will easily fall into excitation, but if you relax too much, you will likely succumb to laxity.</p>

Having achieved the third and fourth stages with the power of mindful-ness, the fifth stage is achieved by the power of introspection.</p>

Buddhist psychology classifies introspection as a form of intelligence (prajna), and its development has long been an important element of Buddhist meditation. A similar mental faculty, usually called metacognition, is now coming under the scrutiny of modern psychologists. Cognitive researchers have defined metacognition as knowledge of one’s own cogni-tive and affective processes and states, as well as the ability to consciously and deliberately monitor and regulate those processes and states.48</p>

Such roving from one meditation object and technique to another, always on the prowl for a greater “bang for your buck,” can undermine any sustained practice of shamatha. Repeatedly experimenting with different techniques can prevent you from achieving expertise in any of them.</p>

While many people practice meditation to achieve “altered states of consciousness,” from a Buddhist perspective, our habitual mindsets, in which we are drawn under the influence of such imbalances as craving, anxiety, stress, and frustration, are already altered states of consciousness.</p>

When you are settling the mind in its natural state, occasionally falling into distraction or grasping, you experience a semblance of what it is like to fall from the state of pristine awareness (Tibetan: rigpa) into the mind of dualistic grasping.

By leaving the eyes open, while focusing your attention on the domain of mental events, the artificial barrier between “inner” and “outer” begins to dissolve. Especially in our materialist society, we have gotten used to the idea that our thoughts and all other mental events are inside our heads. But this has never been demonstrated scientifically. All that is known in this regard is that mental events are correlated with neural events, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that they are located in the same place.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1924<br>
In this practice, by leaving your eyes open but directing your attention to the mind, this conceptually superimposed demarcation between inner and outer begins to erode. You begin to recognize that your thoughts are not occurring in here, in your head, nor are they occurring out there in space.</p>

Sensory objects take on a quality of transparency, as mere appearances to the mind, rather than solid objects “out there.” Even your own body appears “empty” of substance.

But when settling the mind in its natural state, thoughts are anything but continuous. They come and go sporadically, so the stability of attention is not in relation to a specific object. It’s a quality of your subjective aware-ness.</p>

When physical pliancy initially arises, the vital energies catalyze an extraordinary sense of physical bliss, which then triggers an equally excep-tional experience of mental bliss. This rush of physical and mental rapture is transient, which is a good thing, for it so captivates the attention that you can do little else except enjoy it. Gradually it subsides and you are freed from the turbulence caused by this intense joy.</p>

Padmasambhava described this state as follows: Flawless shamatha is like an oil-lamp that is unmoved by the air. Wherever the awareness is placed, it is unwaveringly present; awareness is vividly clear, without being sullied by laxity, lethargy, or dimness; wherever the awareness is directed, it is steady and sharply pointed; and unmoved by adventitious thoughts, it is straight. Thus, a flawless meditative state arises in your mindstream; and until this happens, it is important that you settle the mind in its natural state. Without genuine shamatha arising in your mindstream, even if awareness is pointed out, it becomes nothing more than an object of intellectual under-standing. So you are left simply giving lip-service to the view, and there is the danger that you may succumb to dogmatism. Thus, the root of all meditative states depends upon this, so do not be introduced to pristine awareness too soon, but practice until you have a fine experience of stability.93</p>

		<h2>The Coconut Oil Miracle by Dr. Bruce Fife</h2>

					
		<div class="post">

			
<p>This book repeats itself a lot but there are some excellent things I never knew about coconut. The references would be good to study further. This book is useful to keep in mind for cancer, HIV, herpes, chlamydia, diabetes, osteoporosis, dandruff, sunscreen and many others. </p>



<p>Learnings:</p>



<ul><li>The only oil that is safe for cooking with is coconut oil. Even then, don’t go above 350C (or F can’t remember, it’ll start smoking). This means it’s wise to avoid all restaurant food unless you know they cook with coconut oil. And also canned fish in brine is much better than in oil. And you should drain the oil if it is in oil. </li><li>Coconut oil can remove plaque from arteries. It likewise can remove plaque from teeth/gums. </li><li>Coconut fat was comprised of 60%+ of South/Pacific Islander diet. They had no heart disease problems. </li><li>Multiple kinds of saturated fats. Coconut saturated fat is better than animal saturated fat it seems. </li><li>Coconut oil is safe to keep for 2/3 years. Other oils like olive need to be kept in a dark container and as air tight as possible. As soon as light, heat or oxygen touch it, oxidation begins. In coconut oil this doesn’t happen very fast at all because it is 90+ saturated fats. When oxidation happens it makes it more like free radicals start roaming about in your body. Making chances of cancers etc more likely. This is why foods with antioxidants are good. </li></ul>



<p>Below are my copy-paste highlights from reading the book. </p>

<p>9 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>is a major component of baby formula because it provides many of the same nutrients as human breast milk. I learned that coconut oil </p>



<p>9 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>I’ve seen it get rid of chronic psoriasis, eliminate dandruff, remove precancerous skin lesions, speed recovery from the flu, stop bladder infections, overcome chronic fatigue, and relieve hemorrhoids </p>



<p>9 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Before the introduction of modern foods, many of these people depended almost entirely on coconut to sustain life </p>



<p>9 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Coconuts have been used as a staple part of the diets of almost all Polynesian and Melanesian and many Asian peoples in this area for centuries </p>



<p>9 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>In the Central American country of Panama, people are known to drink coconut oil by the glass to help themselves overcome sickness. They have learned over the generations that consuming coconut oil speeds recovery from illness </p>



<p>9 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Polynesian peoples consume large quantities of fat, primarily from coconut. For some, fat makes up as much as 60 percent of their total calorie intake </p>



<p>9 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>What people don’t realize, however, is that there are many different types of saturated fat and all of them affect the body differently. The type of saturated fat found in coconut oil, a plant source, is different from the type found in animal products </p>



<p>9 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>You will discover why many Asian and Polynesian people call the coconut palm the “Tree of Life. </p>



<p>9 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>few people know the difference between the medium-chain saturated fatty acids in coconut oil and the long-chain saturated fatty acids in meat and other foods </p>



<p>9 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Tragically, the oil that replaced coconut and palm oils was hydrogenated vegetable oil (principally from soybeans)—one of the most health-damaging dietary oils in existence—and the only people who actually benefited from this new health craze were those in the soybean industry </p>



<p>9 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>not made from easily digested medium-chain fatty acids like those found in coconut oil—they are composed of toxic trans fatty acids </p>



<p>9 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Most fats in our foods, if not used immediately as an energy source, are stored as fat tissue on our bodies. Coconut oil, being composed primarily of medium-and short-chain fatty acids, has a totally different effect on the body from that of the typical long-chain fatty acids </p>



<p>9 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Medium-chain fatty acids in coconut oil are broken down and used predominately for energy production and thus seldom end up as body fat or as deposits in arteries or anywhere else. They produce energy, not fat </p>



<p>9 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Research that linked the major killer diseases such as heart disease and cancer to free radicals has expanded to include atherosclerosis, stroke, varicose veins, hemorrhoids, hypertension, wrinkled skin, dermatitis, arthritis, digestive problems, reproductive problems, cataracts, loss of energy, diabetes, allergies, and failing memory </p>



<p>9 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Polyunsaturated oils become toxic when they are oxidized as the result of exposure to oxygen, heat, or light (sunlight or artificial), causing rancidity and the formation of free radicals </p>



<p>9 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Free radicals deplete our antioxidant reserves and cause chemical reactions that damage tissues and cells </p>



<p>9 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>By the time we buy the oil in the store it has already become rancid to some degree. The more processing an oil undergoes, the more chance it has of oxidizing </p>



<p>9 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>safest vegetable oils to use are those processed at low temperatures and packaged in dark containers. Cold-pressed oils are minimally processed, so they retain most of their natural antioxidants </p>



<p>9 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>It’s ironic that people will buy cold-pressed oil at the health food store and then turn it into a health hazard by cooking with it </p>



<p>9 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Even a small amount of heated polyunsaturated vegetable oil, especially if eaten frequently over time, will affect your health </p>



<p>9 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>All vegetable oils should be sealed in airtight, opaque containers and stored in the refrigerator </p>



<p>9 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>If you have oils that have not been stored this way, throw them out now. Your health is more important </p>



<p>9 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>One distinct advantage that all saturated fats have over unsaturated fats (mono-and polyunsaturated fats) is that they don’t have any missing hydrogen atoms or double-bonded carbons. This means that they are not vulnerable to oxidation and free-radical formation as unsaturated fats are <br>
Huh! Interesting. Is olive oil monounsaturated? I think it’s like 15% saturated no? So I should be cooking with coconut oil instead of olive oil. </p>



<p>9 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Food manufacturers have known this for decades. They’ve added saturated fats (often coconut and palm kernel oils) to foods because they help prevent spoilage caused by free radicals </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Our bodies can handle natural fats, but trans fatty acids have no place in our bodies and are linked to many health problems </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>When compared with other oils, it appeared that saturated fat had a protective effect against cancer rather than a causative one. Processed nonhydrogenated polyunsaturated oils were identified as promoting cancer </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Because saturated fats have no double-carbon bonds—the weak links that are easily broken to form free radicals—they are much more stable under a variety of conditions. They can be exposed to heat, light, and oxygen without undergoing any appreciable degree of oxidation or free-radical formation. For this reason, they are preferable for use with food, especially if the food is going to be cooked or stored for any length of time </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Saturated fat remains stable even when heated to normal cooking temperatures. This is why it is far superior to polyunsaturated oil for cooking purposes </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Coconut oil, being a highly saturated fat, is the least vulnerable of all the dietary oils to oxidation and free-radical formation and therefore is the safest to use in cooking </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Fried foods sold in grocery stores and restaurants are usually cooked in hydrogenated oil. Many frozen, processed foods are cooked or prepared in hydrogenated oils </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>oils are used in making french fries, biscuits, cookies, crackers, chips, frozen pies, pizzas, peanut butter, cake frosting, candy, and ice cream substitutes such as mellorine </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Because of this, coconut and MCT oils have been and still are used in hospitals to treat malabsorption syndrome, cystic fibrosis, and epilepsy and to improve protein and fat metabolism and mineral absorption </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Pacific Islanders, who live on traditional diets rich in coconut, don’t get heart disease </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Coconuts have been a staple in the diets of Pacific Islanders for thousands of years. They eat them by the pound every day </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Through the pioneering research of people like Weston A. Price, Ian A. Prior, Jon J. Kabara, and others, we now know that it was the coconut-based diet that was largely responsible for the Islanders’ good health and youthful appearance </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Some of the most thorough research conducted on people who have a high-fat diet derived primarily from coconuts is the Pukapuka and Tokelau Island study </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Coconut palms and a few starchy tropical fruits and root vegetables supply the vast majority of the diet for the population. Fish from the ocean, pigs, and chickens make up what little meat they eat </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Every meal contains coconut in some form: the green nut provides the main beverage; the mature nut, grated or as coconut cream </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>The people averaged two or more bowel movements a day </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>nearly 60 percent of their energy is derived from fat, and almost all of that is saturated fat derived largely from coconuts </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>The term “artery-clogging saturated fat” is a misnomer. The fat that collects in arterial plaque is primarily unsaturated fats (74 percent) and cholesterol </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Saturated fat does not collect in the arteries like poly-and monounsaturated fats because it is not easily oxidized, and only oxidized fat ends up as arterial plaque </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Even the so-called heart-healthy olive oil increases blood clot risk </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>when you eat corn, safflower, soybean, cottonseed, canola, and peanut oils you are increasing your risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke. Eating omega-3 fatty acids and MCFAs, like coconut oil, has the opposite effect on blood platelets </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Studies have revealed that populations who traditionally consume large quantities of coconut as a part of their diet have a low incidence of health problems associated with blood clotting, including heart disease and stroke. </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>The actual cause of heart disease is elusive and appears to be multifactorial </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>in Finland found that 27 out of 40 heart attack patients and 15 out of 30 men with heart disease carried antibodies related to chlamydia, which is more commonly known to cause gum disease and lung infections </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Muhlestein showed that infecting rabbits with chlamydia measurably thickens the arterial walls of the animals. When the animals were given an antibiotic to kill the chlamydia, the arteries became more normal in size. </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>The presence of antibodies does not necessarily indicate an active infection or the presence of atherosclerosis, but it is a sign that infection has occurred at some time. It’s common for infections from these organisms to persist indefinitely. Once one is infected with herpes, for example, the virus remains for life. </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>However, there is something that will destroy both the bacteria (Helicobacter pylori and Chlamydia pneumoniae) and viruses (CMV) that are most commonly associated with atherosclerosis, and that is MCFAs, or coconut oil. Yes, believe it or not. The MCFAs in coconut oil are known to kill all three of the major types of atherogenic organisms </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Research has shown that MCFAs from coconut oil can kill bacteria and viruses that cause influenza, herpes, bladder infections, gum disease, and numerous other conditions <br>
What the holy duck!! Amazing!! </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>The only way to stop a free radical is with an antioxidant </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>A wise farmer, when considering buying a horse, always examines its mouth. He knows that the condition of the animal’s mouth reflects the health of its entire body </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Poor oral health has been linked with numerous health problems, including diabetes and ulcers </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>National Health and Nutritional Examination Study published in the British Medical Journal (vol. 306, pp. 688–91) people with inflammation of the gums had a 25 percent increased risk of heart disease </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Several studies have found that heart disease patients have more tooth decay and higher rates of gum disease </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Those with poor dental health are more likely to suffer a heart attack </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>RobertJ. Genco, D.D.S., Ph.D., of the University of Buffalo, studied 1,372 people over a 10-year period and found that heart disease was three times more prevalent for those with gum disease </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>From these studies it appears that those who have or have had dental infections have a much higher risk of developing heart disease </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>In this view, gum disease does not necessarily lead to heart disease; they each happen at the same time, more or less, as a result of the body’s inability to adequately control the bacteria </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>This is interesting because the Pacific Islanders that Dr. Price studied never brushed their teeth, never flossed, never used antibacterial mouthwash, and never saw dentists; yet they had exquisite dental health, that is, as long as they continued to eat their traditional, coconut-based diet </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>As knowledge of the benefits of coconut oil increases, the soybean industry and its friends will step up their efforts to confuse the public with unfounded criticism and research funding designed to hide the truth and to make its products appear more desirable </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>told her about coconut oil, and she began taking it like a dietary supplement—4 tablespoons a day. The very first day she reported that her arrhythmia had decreased by about 50 percent </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>As they say in Jamaica, “Coconut is a health tonic, good for the heart </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Statistically, nearly one out of every two people you know will die from one of these cardiovascular conditions. In contrast, those people throughout the world who eat the most coconut have the lowest rates of heart disease in the world </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>the people of Sri Lanka used coconut oil in all their cooking. Each person consumed the equivalent of 120 coconuts a year. Despite their large coconut oil consumption heart disease is relatively rare. Only one out of every 100,000 deaths was due to heart disease </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Researchers in India are now recommending the return to coconut oil to reduce the risk of heart disease </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>While antibiotics are losing ground to infectious organisms, nature has provided us an antibiotic that germs cannot develop a resistance to. That natural antibiotic is in the form of the MCFAs commonly found in coconut oil </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Even a tiny speck of blood on a cutting board or knife can transfer the bacteria to raw foods, leading to illness or even death <br>
Eh this is bullshit man. Masaai people <em>drink</em> fresh blood. Maybe blood from CFA animals tho ya </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Antibiotics are only useful against bacteria, not viruses </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>When coconut oil is eaten, the body transforms its unique fatty acids into powerful antimicrobial powerhouses capable of defeating some of the most notorious disease-causing microorganisms. Even the supergerms are vulnerable to these lifesaving coconut derivatives </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Lipid-coated viruses and bacteria are easily killed by MCFAs </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Some have described this oil as “nature’s skin cream” because it prevents drying and cracking of the skin. It also has another very important function: It contains medium-chain fatty acids to fight invading microorganisms <br>
Very interesting. There’s no doubt I’ve felt like my skin has gotten better since introducingncoconut oil </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>When oil is eaten, the triglycerides break apart into diglycerides (two fatty acids joined by a glycerol), monoglycerides (one fatty acid attached to a glycerol), and free fatty acids. It is the monoglycerides and free fatty acids that have the antimicrobial properties </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Coconut and palm kernel oils are by far the richest natural sources of this supernutrient, which makes up about 50 percent of their fat content. Milk fat and butter are a distant second, having about 3 percent. These are the only food sources we have that contain significant amounts of lauric acid </p>

Introduction </p>



<p>The fatty acids that make coconut oil so effective against germs are the same ones nature has put into mother’s milk to protect children. Human breast milk and the milk of other mammals all contain small amounts of MCFAs </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>This is one of the reasons why coconut oil or MCFAs are added to infant formula </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>

<p>The fact that MCFAs digest immediately to produce energy and stimulate metabolism has led athletes to use them as a means to enhance exercise performance </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Saturated fat seems like a good choice to fatten up livestock, so pig farmers tried to feed coconut products to their animals for this purpose, but when it was added to the animal feed, the pigs lost weight! Farmers found that the high polyunsaturated oil content of corn and soybeans quickly did what the coconut oil couldn’t. Animals </p>

Introduction </p>



<p>I have found, however, that it doesn’t work in all cases. If inflammation is severe, coconut oil alone isn’t enough to eliminate it. But for mild cases it has worked well. It </p>

Introduction </p>



<p>For this test, pinch the skin on the back of your hand with the thumb and forefinger and hold it for five seconds. Let go and time how long it takes for the skin to completely flatten back out. The shorter the time, the younger the functional age of the skin. Compare your results to the table. </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>If you want to prevent further degeneration and perhaps even regain some youthfulness in your skin, the best thing you can do is use coconut oil in place of other creams and lotions. I’m in my fifties and when I perform this test, my skin bounces back within 1-2 seconds—just as you would expect from a 20-year-old </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>We use hand and body lotions to soften the skin and make it look younger. Many lotions, however, actually promote dry skin. </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Pure coconut oil is the best natural skin lotion available. It prevents free-radical formation and the damage it causes. It can help prevent the skin from developing liver spots and other blemishes caused by aging and overexposure to sunlight </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>The Polynesians, who traditionally wear very little clothing, have for generations been exposed to the hot blistering sun, yet have beautiful healthy skin without blemishes and without cancer. The reason is they eat coconuts and use the oil on their bodies as a lotion </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>The oil is absorbed into the skin and into the cell structure of the connective tissues, limiting the damage excessive sun exposure can cause. Their skin remains undamaged even when exposed to long hours in the hot sun <br>
What!!!! I need to look this one up. </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>When using coconut oil as a lotion, it is best to apply a small amount and reapply it as often as necessary </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>you apply too much oil all at once, the skin becomes saturated and will not absorb it all. </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>I recommend applying a liberal amount of coconut oil to the affected area and then wrapping it loosely in plastic (so it doesn’t drip all over the place) before going to sleep at night. In the morning remove the plastic and wash off </p>

Introduction </p>



<p>Licking a wound also mixes saliva with the oils on the skin and hair, producing more medium-chain fatty acids that can help fight infection. </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Roze theorized that the oil on the quill contained antibiotic properties that protected him. This theory was verified when the oil was analyzed and tested. The medium-chain fatty acids in the oil proved to be the secret </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>When bathing or showering, soap washes the protective layer of oil and acid off our skin. Often afterward the skin becomes tight and dry. Adding moisturizers helps the skin feel better, but it does not replace the acid or the protective MCFAs that were removed. Your skin is vulnerable to infection at this time </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>By using a coconut or palm kernel oil–based lotion, you can quickly help reestablish the skin’s natural antimicrobial and acid barrier </p>

Introduction </p>



<p>Another advantage of using coconut oil as a hair conditioner is that it will help control dandruff </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>I eventually put some coconut oil in my hair, as just described, and washed it out several hours later. The result was phenomenal. After a single application all the dandruff was gone </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>For example, one of my clients told me he had a flare-up with hemorrhoids that were causing him a great deal of pain and discomfort. He tried various creams, but they didn’t help. He had just purchased a jar of coconut oil and thought he might try that. So he began applying the oil to the affected area, and to his joy and amazement it relieved the irritation </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>One day when the inflammation was flaring up he applied a little coconut oil to see what that would do. It worked! He did it again the next day and the next. Within just a few days the skin on his face, which had once been almost constantly dry and leathery, now became soft and smooth </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Many people claim that, when applied to the skin, coconut oil helps protect them from sunburn and consequently from problems related to overexposure to ultraviolet light, such as the development of skin cancer and aging spots </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Unlike sunscreen, coconut oil doesn’t necessarily block UV light but enables the body to adjust naturally to sun exposure, naturally increasing the body’s tolerance level over time. Because of different skin types, everybody’s level of tolerance is different, so each person needs to experiment, getting a little more sun each day until he or she reaches a level of exposure that feels comfortable </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Traditionally the Polynesians wore very little clothing and exposed themselves to the hot tropical sun nearly all day long </p>

<p>AIDS PREVENTION AND TREATMENT </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>In the 1980s researchers discovered that the medium-chain fatty acids, specifically lauric and capric acids, were effective in killing HIV in lab cultures </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>The first clinical study on the effectiveness of coconut oil to treat HIV patients was reported by Cornrado Dayrit, M.D., emeritus professor of pharmacology at the University of the Philippines and former president of the National Academy of Science and Technology in the Philippines. In this study, 14 HIV patients, ages 22 to 38, were separated into three groups </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>One group (four patients) was given 22 grams of monolaurin a day. The second group (five patients) was given 7.2 grams of monolaurin. The third group (five patients) was given 3½ tablespoons of coconut oil </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Unfortunately, the ready availability and low cost of coconut oil and its derivative fatty acids are reasons why research into its use as a treatment for AIDS and other viral illnesses has been slow. There is little monetary incentive for pharmaceutical companies to fund research on a natural, readily available substance </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>for <br>
There must be a way to create crowd funded research instead. Imagine a new company idea: </p>



<ul><li>We believe incentives in science matter a huge amount. And that science isn’t doing all it can to advance humanity’s knowledge because of misaligned incentives.  <ul><li>We propose a crowdfunded science, that is both funded by the public but also ideas given by the public for what we should research.  <ul><li>Examples we want to study will primarily be medical: <ul><li>oil pulling / coconut oil treatments  <ul><li>blotting technique  <ul><li>eyesight improvement  </li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>The study found that someone with 200,000 virus copies (individual viruses per mm of blood) is 2.5 times more likely to spread HIV than someone with only 2,000 copies. The researchers found no transmission of the virus at all by infected people who carried less than 1,500 copies of the virus </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Home again, six weeks later he went in for another lab test. This time the results showed his viral load had plummeted to undetectable levels. </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Currently some researchers recommended that HIV-infected individuals consume the equivalent of 24–28 grams of lauric acid a day in order to significantly reduce their viral load. This would amount to about 3½ tablespoons (50 grams) of coconut oil </p>

Introduction </p>



<p>In the Pacific Islands, diabetes is unheard-of among those people who eat traditional diets </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Therefore, a diet high in refined polyunsaturated vegetable oils promotes diabetes. A diet low in such oils helps to alleviate symptoms </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>There is one fat that diabetics can eat without fear. That fat is coconut oil. </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Not only does it not contribute to diabetes but it helps regulate blood sugar, thus lessening the effects of the disease </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>The Journal of the Indian Medical Association has reported that Type II diabetes in India has increased as the people have abandoned traditional oils, like coconut oil, in favor of polyunsaturated vegetable oils </p>

<p>RBD AND VIRGIN COCONUT OIL </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Heat such as this isn’t harmful because the oil is very stable even under moderately high temperatures. </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Coconut oil is commonly divided into two broad categories—“refined, bleached, and deodorized” (RBD) and “virgin. </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>The RBD oil is typically made from dried coconut, known as copra, which is made by drying coconut in the sun, smoking it, heating it in a kiln, or some combination of these </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>While high temperatures and chemical solvents are used to produce this oil, it is still considered a healthy dietary oil because the fatty acids in coconut oil are not harmed in the refining process </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Since high temperatures and chemical solvents are not used, the oil retains its naturally occurring phytochemicals (plant chemicals), which produce a distinctive coconut taste and smell. </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>There are some oils that may be labeled “virgin” and are made from sun-dried copra rather than fresh coconut. These are called cochin oils. They have undergone less processing than most RBD oils. This doesn’t mean they are more natural than refined copra oil (RBD); they are actually a lesser or inferior quality. The term “cochin” is derived from a place in India, Cochin, where cheap copra oil is popular </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Often people ask me what type or brand of oil they should use. I have a simple answer. Buy the one that tastes best to you </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>

Introduction </p>



<p>HOW MUCH COCONUT OIL DO YOU NEED </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>an adult of average size would need 3½ tablespoons (50 grams) of coconut oil a day to equal the proportion of MCFAs a nursing baby receives </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Studies have shown that the antimicrobial effects of MCFAs increases with the quantity used, so the greater the number of these infection-fighting fatty acids available in our bodies, the greater our protection. Eating more should provide greater health benefits, not only in preventing illness but in improving digestion and nutrient absorption, protecting against heart disease, and so on </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>It is not known for certain whether it is possible to consume too much coconut. Coconut oil is essentially nontoxic to humans. It is considered safer than soy, which many people eat by the pound </p>



<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>We know that certain island populations consume large amounts of coconut oil, as much as 10 tablespoons a day, and have excellent health </p>

<p>Eliminate all margarine, shortening, and processed vegetable oils from your diet. Olive oil and butter are okay, but use coconut oil whenever possible </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>coconut oil is primarily a saturated fat, the heat of cooking does not create a free-radical soup as it does with other vegetable oils. You can feel safe knowing that you aren’t damaging your health when you eat it. From all the research that has been done to this point, it appears that coconut oil is the healthiest all-purpose oil you can use </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>I like to use a mixture of olive and coconut oils for my salads. </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>When coconut oil is mixed with olive oil it remains liquid when poured on a salad </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>For frying, nothing beats coconut oil. It isn’t absorbed into foods as much as other vegetable oils, doesn’t splatter as much, and can be used over again </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>

<p>Any oil, including coconut oil, will produce toxic byproducts if overheated. </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Coconut oil is very stable and does not need to be refrigerated. It will stay fresh for at least two or three years unrefrigerated. If kept in a cool place it will last even longer, so it makes a good storage oil </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>I’ve heard of coconut oil being analyzed after sitting on the shelf for 15 years and still being unoxidized and safe to use </p>

<p>Coconut also contains as much protein as an equal amount of green beans, carrots, and most other vegetables. It contains vitamins B1, B2, B3, B6, C, and E, folic acid, and the minerals calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, and zinc, among others </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Since the saturated fat is highly resistant to oxidation and spoilage, shredded coconut will last for many months, whereas fresh coconut can spoil in a matter of days </p>

<p>APPLYING COCONUT OIL TO YOUR SKIN AND HAIR </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>To help control dandruff and improve the appearance of your hair, apply the oil to your scalp and massage it in. Work it into the skin. Let the oil soak into your scalp and hair for a period of time, at least 15 minutes; the longer the better. Then wash it out. If you like, you can apply a small amount of coconut oil to your hair after you get out of the shower. Use only a little. You don’t want your hair to look or feel greasy </p>

<p>13 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>After reading about all the wonderful things coconut oil can do, it’s tempting to think of it as a panacea for all illnesses. While coconut oil is good, keep in mind that it’s not a cure-all </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>If you take 3–4 tablespoons of coconut oil every day and eat a healthy diet, you probably won’t get sick </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>Use coconut oil for all your cooking needs, and use extra virgin olive oil in your salad dressing. </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>recommend you start off slowly. Try 1 or 2 teaspoons of coconut oil first. Sometimes people take too much and their bodies are not accustomed to handling so much oil, and they experience runny stools </p>



<p>10 March 2019 <br>
Introduction </p>



<p>If you have a choice, request olive or coconut oil whenever possible. Choose butter over margarine </p>

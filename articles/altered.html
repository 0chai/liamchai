		<h2>Altered Traits by Daniel Goleman and Richard Davidson</h2>

					
		<div class="post">

			
<p>A good book for a summary of the latest scientific research around meditation. It was interesting to see how interconnected all the major figures are within the mindfulness movement. How many of them met each other and kept working in the field to help establish the movement in the modern world. </p>



<p>The biggest highlight for me was the studies done on Mingyur Rinpoche. His abilities to ramp up gamma waves on command by several orders of magnitude was incredible. I also enjoyed their use of the term ‘olympic level’ meditators.  </p>



<h3><span id="Altered_Traits_by_Daniel_Goleman_and_Richard_Davidson"><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.richardjdavidson.com/altered-traits" target="_blank">Altered Traits</a> by Daniel Goleman and Richard Davidson</span></h3>



<p>1 | The Deep Path and the Wide </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 49 <br>
There are, then, two paths: the deep and the wide. Those two paths are often confused with each other, though they differ greatly. </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 58 <br>
Level 4 are, of necessity, the most watered-down, all the better to render them handy for the largest number of people. The current vogues of mindfulness-at-your-desk, or via minutes-long meditation apps, exemplify this level. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 61 <br>
Level 5, the lessons scientists have learned in studying all the other levels will lead to innovations and adaptations that can be of widest benefit—a </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 97 <br>
An altered trait—a new characteristic that arises from a meditation practice—endures apart from meditation itself. Altered traits shape how we behave in our daily lives, not just during or immediately after we meditate.</p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 113 <br>
these deep changes are external signs of strikingly different brain function. </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 119 <br>
The very idea of “awakening”—the goal of the deep path—seems a quaint fairy tale to a modern sensibility. Yet data from Richie’s lab, some just being published in journals as this book goes to press, confirm that remarkable, positive alterations in brain and behavior along the lines of those long described for the deep path are not a myth but a reality. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 168 <br>
Among the iffy findings gone viral with enthusiastic claims: that meditation thickens the brain’s executive center, the prefrontal cortex, while shrinking the amygdala, the trigger for our freeze-fight-or-flight response; that meditation shifts our brain’s set point for emotions into a more positive range; that meditation slows aging; and that meditation can be used to treat diseases ranging from diabetes to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. On closer look, each of the studies on which these claims are based has problems with the methods used; they need more testing and corroboration to make firm claims. Such findings may well stand up to further scrutiny—or maybe not. </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 183 <br>
In chapter thirteen, “Altering Traits,” we lay out the benefits of meditation at three levels: beginner, long-term, and “Olympic.” </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 237 <br>
At the outset, mere minutes a day of practice have surprising benefits (though not all those that are claimed). Beyond such payoffs at the beginning, we can now show that the more hours you practice, the greater the benefits you reap. And at the highest levels of practice we find true altered traits—changes in the brain that science has never observed before, but which we proposed decades ago. </p>



<p>2 | Ancient Clues </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 260 <br>
Before meeting Khunu Lama, Dan had spent months with an Indian yogi, Neem Karoli Baba, </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 266 <br>
Maharaji’s only worldly possessions seemed to be the white cotton dhoti he wore on hot days and the heavy woolen plaid blanket he wrapped around himself on cold ones. He kept no particular schedule, had no organization, nor offered any fixed program of yogic poses or meditations. Like most sadhus, he was itinerant, unpredictably on the move. He mainly hung out on a tucket on the porch of whatever ashram, temple, or home he was visiting at the time. </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 269 <br>
Maharaji seemed always to be absorbed in some state of ongoing quiet rapture, and, paradoxically, at the same time was attentive to whoever was with him.1 </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 273 <br>
No matter what he was doing, he seemed to remain effortlessly in a blissful, loving space, perpetually at ease. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 292 <br>
Dan took five of Goenka’s ten-day courses in a row, immersing himself in this rich meditation method. </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 299 <br>
What had been “my body, my knee” becomes a sea of shifting sensation—a radical shift in awareness. </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 312 <br>
Spiritual literature throughout Eurasia converges in descriptions of an internal liberation from everyday worry, fixation, self-focus, ambivalence, and impulsiveness—one that manifests as freedom from concerns with the self, equanimity no matter the difficulty, a keenly alert “nowness,” and loving concern for all. </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 352 <br>
staunch behaviorists, followers of B. F. Skinner, dominated the psychology department.8 Their firm assumption was that only observable behavior was the proper study of psychology—looking inside the mind was a questionable endeavor, a taboo waste of time. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 359 <br>
Richie’s steely conviction was that psychology should study the mind—not reinforcement schedules for pigeons—and so he became a rebel. Richie’s interests in what went on in the mind were, from the strict behaviorist perspective, transgressive.10 </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 391 <br>
“unshakable conviction” that “our normal waking consciousness&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is but one special type of consciousness, whilst all about it, parted from it by the filmiest of screens, there lie potential forms of consciousness entirely different.”14 </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 394 <br>
“We may go through life without suspecting their existence; but apply the requisite stimulus, and at a touch they are there in all their completeness.” </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 401 <br>
From the early days of psychology, beginning with Freud himself, altered states were dismissed as symptoms of one or another form of psychopathology. </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 402 <br>
Romain Rolland became a disciple of the Indian saint Sri Ramakrishna around the beginning of the twentieth century, he wrote to Freud describing the mystical state he experienced—and Freud diagnosed it as regression to infancy.15 </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 404 <br>
By the 1960s, psychologists routinely dismissed drug-triggered altered states as artificially induced psychosis (the original term for psychedelics was “psychotomimetic” drugs—psychosis mimics). </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 436 <br>
Soon Richie found himself entering a state of total absorption that, toward the end of the retreat, allowed him to sit for up to four hours at a go. At lights-out time he’d go to the empty meditation hall and meditate on his body’s sensations steadily, sometimes until 1:00 or 2:00 a.m. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 440 <br>
For days after the retreat ended, Richie still felt he was on a high. Richie’s mind kept soaring while he and Susan stayed on in Dalhousie. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 443 <br>
There Richie felt that high begin to wane </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 452 <br>
Richie tried to revive the state he had reached at the Dalhousie course, but it had vanished. It reminded him of a psychedelic trip in that way: he had vivid memories of the retreat, but they were not embodied, not a lasting transformation. They were just memories. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 454 <br>
How long do state effects—like Richie’s meditative highs—last? At what point can they be considered enduring traits? What allows such a transformation of being to become embodied in a lasting way instead of fading into the mists of memory? </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 460 <br>
Though centuries old, the Visuddhimagga remained the definitive guidebook for meditators in places like Burma and Thailand, that follow the Theravada tradition, </p>



<p>Highlight(blue) – Location 468 <br>
At first the flow of thoughts rushes like a waterfall, which sometimes discourages beginners, who feel their mind is out of control. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 471 <br>
The stream of thought flows more slowly, like a river—and finally rests in the stillness of a lake, as an ancient metaphor for settling the mind in meditation practice tells us. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 483 <br>
Jhana alone, the Buddha is said to have declared, was not the path to a liberated mind. Though strong concentration can be an enormous aid along the way, the Buddha’s path veers into a different kind of inner focus: the path of insight. </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 487 <br>
With mindfulness, the meditator simply notes without reactivity whatever comes into mind, such as thoughts or sensory impressions like sounds—and lets them go. The operative word here is go. If we think much of anything about what just arose, or let it trigger any reactivity at all, we have lost our mindful stance—unless </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 495 <br>
But with strong mindfulness we can experience a deep sense in which self-loathing and romantic thoughts are the same: like all other thoughts, these are passing moments of mind. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 497 <br>
Once we glimpse our mind as a set of processes, rather than getting swept away by the seductions of our thoughts, we enter the path of insight. </p>



<p>Highlight(blue) – Location 509 <br>
The tale speaks to the difference between meditation highs and enduring change. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 515 <br>
But Richie’s delicious meditation-induced high—possibly somewhere in the vicinity of access concentration, if not first jhana—was not sufficient to bring on these trait changes. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 520 <br> The sudden revelations of drug-induced altered states led to assumptions like, as one acidhead put it, “With LSD we experienced what it took Tibetan monks 20 years to obtain, yet we got there in 20 minutes.”20 Dead wrong. The trouble with drug-induced states is that after the chemical clears your body, you remain the same person as always. </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 523 <br> And, as Richie discovered, the same fading away happens with highs in meditation. </p>



<p>3 | The After Is the Before for the Next During </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 526 <br>
“ethnopsychology,” </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 535 <br>
All too often our mental states fluctuate in a range that highlights desires, self-centeredness, sluggishness, agitation, and the like. These are among the unhealthy states on this map of mind. Healthy states, in contrast, include even-mindedness, composure, ongoing mindfulness, and realistic confidence. Intriguingly, a subset of healthy states applies to both mind and body: buoyancy, flexibility, adaptability, and pliancy. </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 540 <br>
While immersed in deep concentration, a meditator’s unhealthy states are suppressed—but, as with that yogi in the bazaar, can emerge as strong as ever when the concentrative state subsides. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 568 <br> We contended that hypnosis, unlike meditation, produced primarily state effects, and not trait effects as with meditation. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 580 <br>
true mark of a meditator is that he has disciplined his mind by freeing it from negative emotions.” </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 598 <br>
We were, to say the least, outliers in psychology—or oddballs, as we no doubt were perceived by some of our Harvard colleagues. Our vision of altered traits made a leap far beyond the psychological science of our day. Risky business. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 603 <br>
science needs to balance skeptics with speculators—people who cast wide nets, think imaginatively, and consider “what if.” </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 605 <br>
Economist Joseph Schumpeter has become known these days for the concept of “creative destruction,” where the new disrupts the old in a market. Our early hunches about altered traits fit what Schumpeter called “vision”: an intuitive act that supplies direction and energy for analytic efforts. A vision lets you see things in a new light, as he says, one “not to be found in the facts, methods, and results of the preexisting state of the science.”8 </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 621 <br>
McEwen’s results ripped through the brain and behavioral sciences like a small tsunami, opening minds to the possibility that a given experience could leave an imprint on the brain. </p>



<p>Highlight(orange) – Location 622 <br>
a holy grail for psychology: how stressful events produce lingering neural scars. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 632 <br>
The conventional wisdom then was that at birth we host in our skull a maximum number of neurons, and then inexorably lose them in a steady die-off over the course of life. Experience, supposedly, had nothing to do with this. <br>
Note – Location 637 <br>
I wonder how many thousands of ideas are like this in science, where religion or mythical traditions or folklore have discovered certain truths that science is still waiting to catch up on. </p>



<p>Highlight(orange) – Location 641 <br>
The battle had a long, ugly history—racists in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries twisted the genetics of their day as “scientific” grounds for bias against blacks, Native Americans, Jews, the Irish, and a long list of other targets of bigotry. The racists attributed any and all lags in educational and economic attainments of the target group to their genetic destiny, ignoring vast imbalances in opportunity. <br>
Note – Location 644 <br>
How many other scientific positions are influenced by such ideological stances? Climate change? After life? Introspection? </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 647 <br>
For the first time in public he proposed the concept of “neuroplasticity” <br>
Note – Location 647 <br>
Oh! Didn’t realise it was Richie who first proposed neuroplasticity. That’s huge. That means the Dalai Lama was actually a MASSIVE proponent of this discovery. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 651 <br>
findings—for instance, those showing that mastering a musical instrument enlarged the relevant brain centers.11 </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 653 <br>
The longer they had played, the greater the size.12 </p>



<p>Highlight(orange) – Location 658 <br>
Most people lose sight of their finger as it moves to the far right or left of their nose. But one group does not: people who are deaf. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 668 <br>
The brains of deaf people, Neville discovered, had morphed so that what is ordinarily a part of the auditory system was now working with the visual circuitry.14 </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 690 <br>
Alexander the Great was leading his armies through what is now Kashmir, legend has it </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 694 <br>
The Greek-derived word for these yogis is gymnosophists, literally “naked philosophers” </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 698 <br>
The Greek schools of philosophy espoused an ideal of personal transformation that remarkably echoes those of Asia, as Alexander may have found in his exchanges with Kalyana. The Greeks and their heirs the Romans, of course, laid the foundation for Western thought down to the present day. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 700 <br>
Aristotle posited the goal of life as a virtue-based eudaimonia—a quality of flourishing—a </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 705 <br>
For the Stoics, one key was seeing that our feelings about life’s events, not those events themselves, determine our happiness; we find equanimity by distinguishing what we can control in life from what we cannot. Today that creed finds an echo in the popularized Twelve Step version of theologian Reinhold Niebuhr’s prayer: </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 708 <br>
God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, Courage to change the things I can, And wisdom to know the difference. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 710 <br>
These Greek schools saw philosophy as an applied art and taught contemplative exercises and self-discipline as paths to flourishing. Like their peers to the East, </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 716 <br>
In Buddhism, for example, the ideal of inner flourishing gets put in terms of bodhi (in Pali and Sanskrit), a path of self-actualization that nourishes “the very best within oneself.”20 </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 719 <br>
Today’s psychology uses the term well-being for a version of the Aristotelian meme flourishing. </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 720 <br>
a model of well-being with six arms: </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 724 <br>
“Each of you is perfect the way you are,” Zen master Suzuki Roshi told his students, adding, “and you can use a little improvement”—neatly </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 726 <br>
Autonomy, independence in thought and deed, freedom from social pressure, and using your own standards to measure yourself. This, by the way, applies most strongly in individualistic cultures like Australia and the United States, as compared with cultures like Japan, where harmony with one’s group looms larger. </p>



<p>Highlight(orange) – Location 741 <br>
Frankl’s sentiment resonates with a finding that after a three-month meditation retreat (about 540 hours total), those practitioners who had strengthened a sense of purpose in life during that time also showed a simultaneous increase in the activity of telomerase in their immune cells, even five months later.24 </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 745 <br>
It’s as though the body’s cells were saying, stick around—you’ve got important work to do. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 755 <br>
But meditation research varies enormously when it comes to scientific soundness—though when used to promote some brand of meditation, app, or other contemplative “product,” this inconvenient truth goes missing. </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 758 <br>
What does science actually tell us about the impacts of meditation? <br>
4 | The Best We Had </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 773 <br>
Dan told those assigned to a control group picked at random to simply sit and relax. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 779 <br>
From that viewpoint, Dan’s research—and the majority of studies of meditation even today—has flaws. </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 780 <br>
For instance, Dan was the person who taught the volunteers to meditate or told them to just relax. But Dan knew the desired outcome, that meditation should help more—and that could well have influenced how he spoke to the two groups, perhaps in a way that encouraged good results from meditation and poor ones from the control condition who just relaxed. </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 784 <br>
Dan’s study is not alone; that attitude prevails still today. Replicability, as it’s known in the trade, stands as a strength of the scientific method; any other scientist should be able to reproduce a given experiment and yield the same findings—or reveal the failure to reproduce them. But very, very few ever even try. <br>
Note – Location 786 <br>
Wtf? What is this shit. Ppl don’t even try??? </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 790 <br>
the field’s incentives favor original work, not duplication. </p>



<p>Highlight(orange) – Location 790 <br>
Plus, psychology, like all sciences, has a strong inbuilt publication bias: scientists rarely try to publish studies when they get no significant results. And yet that null finding itself has significance. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 793 <br>
If you ask people to report on their own behaviors, feelings, and the like—soft measures—psychological factors like a person’s mood of the moment and wanting to look good or please the investigator can influence enormously how they respond. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 825 <br>
The net effect of such a bias would be to make meditators’ sweat response seem to react more to the accident, while recovering more quickly (however, as we shall see, this is precisely the pattern found in the most advanced meditators studied so far). </p>



<p>Highlight(orange) – Location 826 <br>
Research on bias has found two levels: our conscious predilections and, harder to counter, our unconscious ones. </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 828 <br>
Along those lines, Dan shared the dilemma of most scientists who do research on meditation: they are themselves meditators, which can encourage such bias, even if unconscious. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 839 <br>

Back in 1975 we were quite naive about how important these variations in technique were. Today we know there are many aspects of attention, and that different kinds of meditation train a variety of mental habits, and so, impact mental skills in varying ways. </p>

Breath focus, they found, was calming—seeming to confirm a widespread assumption about meditation’s usefulness as a means to relax. But in contradiction to that stereotype, neither the loving-kindness practice nor monitoring thoughts made the body more relaxed, apparently because each demands mental effort: for example, while watching thoughts you continually get swept up in them—and then, when you notice this has happened, need to make a conscious effort to simply watch again. In addition, the loving-kindness practice, where you wish yourself and others well, understandably created a positive mood, while the other two methods did not. </p>

But in this study, both groups reported comparable improvement on these subjective measures of general distress, anxiety, and medical symptoms. This led Richie’s group to conclude that much of the stress relief improvements beginners credit to meditation do not seem to be that unique.13 </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 947 <br>
This led Richie’s lab to conclude that for this variety of mindfulness, and likely for any other meditation, many of the reported benefits in the early stages of practice can be chalked up to expectation, social bonding in the group, instructor enthusiasm, or other “demand characteristics.” Rather than being from meditation per se, any reported benefits may simply be signs that people have positive hopes and expectations. </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 952 <br>
Just finding that people practicing one or another kind of meditation report improvements compared to those in a control group who do nothing does not mean such benefits are due to the meditation itself.

This is not as simple as it may sound. In the test you press the down arrow on a keyboard on each outbreath. And to up the odds, on every ninth exhale you tap a different key, the right arrow. Then you start counting your breaths from one to nine again.22 <br>

As the brain’s radar for threat, the amygdala rivets our attention on what it finds troubling.

If the outcome measures are based on self-reports (the most easily swayed by expectations) or even behavior observed by someone else (somewhat less susceptible to bias) then an active control group matters greatly.

Seven years after his three-month retreat experiment ended, Cliff Saron tracked down the participants.16 He found a surprise among those who, during and just after the retreat, were able to sustain attention to disturbing images of suffering—a psychophysiological measure of acceptance, as opposed to the averted gaze and expression of disgust he found in others (and which typifies people in general). Those who did not avert their eyes but took in that suffering were, seven years later, better able to remember those specific pictures.

When we choose to concentrate on visual sensations and ignore what we touch, the lights are “signal” and the touch “noise.” When we get distracted, noise drowns the signal; concentration means much more signal than noise. </p>

After eight weeks those who had gone through the MBSR program showed a far better ability to focus on sensations—in this case a carefully calibrated tapping on their hand or foot—than they had done before starting the MBSR training, as well as better than those who were still waiting for MBSR. </p>

<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1684 <br>
And to show even more convincingly that the link between meditation and sustained attention is not mere association, but rather a causal one, requires a longitudinal study. That higher bar was met by Clifford Saron and Alan Wallace’s study, where volunteers attended a three-month meditation retreat with Wallace as teacher.8 </p>

After each string or fifteen or so, you are asked if you saw any numbers and what they were. If two numbers were presented in a rapid-fire sequence most people tend to miss the second number. That’s the attentional blink. </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 1714 <br>
Richie’s group measured the attentional blink in vipassana meditators before and after that three-month retreat. After the retreat there was a dramatic reduction, 20 percent, in the attentional blink.9 </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1719 <br>
Once the news was out in science circles, a group of researchers in Germany asked whether meditation training might offset the universal worsening with age of the attentional blink, which becomes more frequent and creates longer gaps in awareness as people get older.10 Yes: meditators who regularly practiced some form of “open monitoring” (a spacious awareness of whatever comes to mind) reversed the usual escalation of attentional blinks with aging, even doing better than another group taken entirely from a younger population. </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 1723 <br>
researchers speculate, the nonreactive open awareness—simply noticing and allowing whatever comes into the mind “just to be” rather than following a chain of thoughts about it—becomes a cognitive skill that transfers over to registering a target like the letters and numbers on the blink test without getting caught up in it. That leaves their attention ready for the next target in the sequence—a more efficient way to witness the passing world. <br>

digital distractions claim another kind of victim: basic human skills like empathy and social presence. </p>



<p>Highlight(blue) – Location 1738 <br>
The symbolic meaning of eye contact, of putting aside what we are doing to connect, lies in the respect, care, even love it indicates. A lack of attention to those around us sends a message of indifference. Such social norms for attention to the people we are with have silently, inexorably shifted. </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 1742 <br>
But compelling research at Stanford University has shown that this very idea is a myth—the brain does not “multitask” but rather switches rapidly from one task (my work) to others (all those funny videos, friends’ updates, urgent texts&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ).12 </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 1745 <br>
Attention tasks don’t really go on in parallel, as “multitasking” implies; instead they demand rapid switching from one thing to the other. And following every such switch, when our attention returns to the original task, its strength has been appreciably diminished. It can take several minutes to ramp up once again to full concentration. <br>

Heavy multitaskers, the Stanford group discovered, are more easily distracted in general. And when multitaskers do try to focus on that one thing they have to get done, their brains activate many more areas than just those relevant to the task at hand—a neural indicator of distraction. </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 1752 <br>
Clifford Nass, one of the researchers, put it, multitaskers are “suckers for irrelevancy,” which hampers not just concentration but also analytic understanding and empathy.13 </p>

The good news for multitaskers: cognitive control can be strengthened. Undergrads volunteered to try ten-minute sessions of either focusing on counting their breath or an apt comparison task: browsing Huffington Post, Snapchat, or BuzzFeed.14 Just three ten-minute sessions of breath counting was enough to appreciably increase their attention skills on a battery of tests. And the biggest gains were among the heavy multitaskers, who did more poorly on those tests initially. </p>

There are two varieties of experience: the “mere awareness” of a thing, which our ordinary consciousness gives us, versus knowing you are aware of that thing—recognizing awareness itself, without judgment or other emotional reactions. For example, </p>

Psychologists at UC–Santa Barbara used such a mental challenge with people learning mindfulness for the first time, as well as a group who had a course in nutrition.21 Meta-awareness improved in the meditation group, but not a whit in those taking the nutrition class. </p>

Our hunch would be that pushing a neural system like attention in a lasting way requires not just these short trainings and continued daily practice, but also intensive booster sessions, as was the case with those who were at the shamatha retreat and then were tested five months later in Cliff Saron’s study. Otherwise the brain’s wiring will regress to its previous status: a life of distraction punctuated with periods of concentration. <br>

The pain had not vanished, but Richie had changed his relationship to it. There was just raw sensation—not my pain, along with the usual stream of angst-ridden thoughts. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1862 <br>
In that hour Richie, with his science background, realized in his most personal reality that what we label as “pain” is a joining together of myriad constituent somatic sensations from which the label arises. With his newly altered perception, “pain” became just an idea, a mental label that puts a conceptual veneer over what arises from a motley coincidence of sensations, perceptions, and resistant thoughts. </p>

although the brain makes up only 2 percent of the body’s mass, it consumes about 20 percent of the body’s metabolic energy as measured by its oxygen usage, and that rate of oxygen consumption remains more or less constant no matter what we are doing—including nothing at all.

They typically reported that their minds were wandering; most often, this mind-wandering was focused on the self—How am I doing in this experiment? I wonder what they are learning about me; I need to reply to Joe’s phone message—all reflecting mental activity focused on “I” and “me.”2 </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 1901 <br>

In the same way, cognitive science tells us, our sense of self emerges as a property of the many neural subsystems that thread together, among other streams, our memories, our perceptions, our emotions, and our thoughts.

all those tested were encouraged to distinguish between simply noting the identity of an experience (itching is occurring, say) and identifying with it (I itch)—and then to let go.

<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 1977 <br>
Our sense of self gets woven in an ongoing personal narrative that threads together disparate parts of our life into a coherent story line.

the long-term meditators seemed to have roughly the same lessened connectivity in the default mode circuitry while they just rested before the test as they displayed during mindfulness.

Along these lines, Richie’s group found that meditators who had an average 7,500 lifetime hours, compared to people their own age, had decreased gray matter volume in a key region: the nucleus accumbens.13 This was the only brain region showing a difference in brain structure compared to age-matched controls.

there’s the issue of what kind of meditation has which physiological impacts. Tania Singer’s group compared concentrating on the breath with loving-kindness and also with mindfulness, looking at how each influenced heart rate and how much effort meditators reported the methods took.22 The breath meditation was the most relaxing, with loving-kindness and mindfulness both boosting heart rate a bit, a sign these take more effort.

Over the course of a single day that difference in breath rate translates to more than 2,000 extra breaths for the nonmeditators—and more than 800,000 extra breaths over the course of a year. These extra breaths are physiologically taxing, and can exact a health toll as time goes on. <br>

The study at the biotech start-up seemed to show a remarkable shift in brain function after the meditation training—from tilting toward the right to a leftward pitch, and reporting a switch into a more relaxed state.

<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 2353 <br>
The problem: Richie’s lab has not been able to show that this tilt toward left-side activation continues to grow stronger the more you meditate. Richie hit a snag when he started bringing to his lab Olympic-level meditators, Tibetan yogis (more about them in chapter twelve, “Hidden Treasure”). These experts, who had logged off-the-charts hours of meditation, did not show the expected whopping leftward tilt—despite being some of the most optimistic and happy people Richie has ever known. This undermined Richie’s confidence in the measure, which he has discontinued. Richie has no sure sense of why that left/right measure failed to work as expected with the yogis. One possibility: a tilt toward the left may occur at the beginning of meditation practice, but other than a small range of change, the left/right ratio does not budge much. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 2360 <br>
Our current thinking holds that in later stages of meditation other mechanisms kick in, so that what changes is your relation to any and all emotions, rather than the ratio of positive to negative ones.

11 | A Yogi’s Brain </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 2642 <br>
Arriving at a yogi’s hermitage, the scientists presented the letter and through a translator asked to monitor the yogi’s brain while he meditated. The same answer came from each yogi in turn: No. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 2645 <br>
Some may have heard about another yogi who once had been persuaded by a similar letter from the Dalai Lama to leave his retreat and travel to a university in faraway America to demonstrate his ability to raise his core body temperature at will. That yogi had died soon after his return, and rumors on the mountainside held that the experiment had played a role. </p>

Moreover, of the eight yogis the team met on this expedition, only one had ever seen an actual computer before Richie and the team arrived. </p>

What mattered to them was how the results might influence others for better or worse. Prospects for scientific studies were dim. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 2669 <br>
Matthieu himself was the first monk to come for study at Richie’s lab, spending several days as experimental subject and as collaborator on methods to refine the protocol used with a succession of other yogis. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 2675 <br>
This put Matthieu at the heart of a large network within the Tibetan meditative world. He knew whom to suggest as potential subjects of study—and, perhaps most important, was trusted by those very meditation experts. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 2686 <br>
Matthieu’s crucial reassurances have so far brought twenty-one of these most advanced meditators to Richie’s lab for brain studies. That number includes seven Westerners </p>

Closing the gap between the first and third person was the idea of Francisco Varela, the brilliant biologist and cofounder of the Mind and Life Institute. In his academic writing Varela proposed a method for combining the first-and third-person lenses with a “second person,” an expert on the topic being studied.6 </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 2703 <br>
Matthieu explained to Richie and his team that the meditator also cultivates a particular emotional state that goes along with a given image—say, with an image of the bodhisattva Tara the accompanying state melds compassion and loving-kindness. </p>

What might be next as contemplative science continues to evolve? The Dalai Lama, a twinkle in his eye, once told Dan that someday “the person being studied and the person doing the research will be one and the same.” <br>

Aha.. interesting! </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 2744 <br>
Mingyur was the first yogi studied after that initial session with Matthieu. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 2747 <br>
The protocol had Mingyur alternate between one minute of meditation on compassion and thirty seconds of a neutral resting period. To </p>

He had assured them that these mental gymnastics would be no problem for someone at Mingyur’s level of expertise. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 2758 <br>
Just as Mingyur began the meditation, there was a sudden huge burst of electrical activity on the computer monitors displaying the signals from his brain. Everyone assumed this meant he had moved; such movement artifacts are a common problem in research with EEG, which registers as wave pattern readings of electrical activity at the top of the brain. Any motion that tugs the sensors—a leg shifting, a tilt of the head—gets amplified in those readings into a huge spike that looks like a brain wave and has to be filtered out for a clean analysis. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 2776 <br>
in one he was asked to generate an elaborate visual image; in the other he was assessed to see if he had any knack for extrasensory perception. The cognitive scientist had high hopes that he would document the achievements of an extraordinary subject. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 2780 <br>
The net result of Mingyur’s day in that lab: he flunked both tests, doing no better than the college sophomores who were the usual subjects of study there. </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 2781 <br>
Mingyur, it turned out, had done no practice with visualization since the long-gone, early years of his practice. As time went on, his meditations evolved. His current method, ongoing open presence (which expresses itself as kindness in everyday life), encourages letting go of any and all thoughts rather than generating any specific visual images. Mingyur’s practice actually ran counter to the purposeful generation of an image and the feelings that go along with it—perhaps reversing any skill he might once have had in that. His circuitry for visual memory had gotten no particular workout, despite his thousands of hours spent in other kinds of mental training. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 2794 <br>
That traditional scientific stance completely missed the chance to assess Mingyur’s actual meditative talents, as did our earlier failure to take the measure of nibbana. </p>

Mingyur was a meditation prodigy, as the lab team learned while tallying his history of lifetime hours of the practice: at that point, 62,000. </p>

While Mingyur has as of this writing been on retreats for a total of ten of his forty-two years, Tulku Urgyen reputedly had done more than twenty years of retreat over his lifetime; Mingyur’s grandfather—Tulku Urgyen’s father—was said to have put in more than thirty years on retreat.11 </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 2817 <br>
He entered a three-year meditation retreat when he was just thirteen, a decade or more earlier than most who undertake such a challenge. And by the end of that retreat he proved so proficient that he was made meditation master for the next three-year round, which began soon after the first ended. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 2821 <br>
Some years before, he had announced he would be starting another three-year retreat—his third. But to everyone’s shock, instead of going into a remote hermitage with an attendant along to cook and care for him as is traditional, he disappeared one night from his monastery in Bodh Gaya, India, taking only his robes, a bit of cash, and an ID card. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 2824 <br>
During his odyssey Mingyur lived as a wandering mendicant, spending winters as a sadhu on the plains of India and during the warmer months inhabiting Himalayan caves where fabled Tibetan masters had stayed. Such a wandering retreat, not uncommon in old Tibet, has become rare, especially among Tibetans like Mingyur whose diaspora has brought them into the modern world. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 2826 <br>
During those wandering years there was not a word from him, save once when he was recognized by a Taiwanese nun at a retreat cave. He gave her a letter (telling her to send it after he had moved on) that said not to worry, he was fine—and exhorting his students to practice. A photo that surfaced when a monk, a longtime friend, managed to join Mingyur shows a radiant face with a wispy beard and long hair, his expression one of ebullient rapture. </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 2830 <br>
Then, suddenly, in November 2015, after almost four and a half years as a wanderer in radio silence, Mingyur reappeared at his monastery in Bodh Gaya. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 2842 <br>
Although he was barraged with requests, following his return from this last retreat, to have his brain scanned by many labs all over the world, Mingyur turned most all of them down for fear of becoming a perpetual subject. He had consented to have his brain rescanned by Richie and his team because he knew they had longitudinal data from previous scans and could analyze ways his brain might be showing atypical changes. </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 2845 <br>
The first scan Richie’s lab had of Mingyur’s brain was obtained in 2002; there was another in 2010 and now the most recent, in 2016. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 2854 <br>
Comparing Mingyur’s brain to norms for his age, he falls in the 99th percentile—that is, if we had 100 people who are the same chronological age as Mingyur (forty-one years at this scan), his brain would be the youngest in a group of 100 age-and gender-matched peers. After his latest retreat as a wanderer, when the lab compared Mingyur’s brain changes to those of a control group over the same period of time, Mingyur’s brain is clearly aging more slowly. </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 2857 <br>
Although his chronological age was forty-one at the time, his brain fit most closely the norms for those whose chronological age was thirty-three. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 2860 <br>
The total hours of practice Mingyur put in during his years as a wanderer are difficult to calculate. At his level of expertise, “meditation” becomes an ongoing feature of awareness—a trait—not a discrete act. In a very real sense, he practices continuously, day and night. In fact, in his lineage the distinction made is not the conventional equation of meditation with time spent in a session sitting on a cushion versus regular life, but rather, between being in a meditative state or not, no matter what else you are doing. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 2865 <br>
But the findings from Mingyur were only anecdotal, a single case that might be explained many different ways. For instance, perhaps his remarkable family has some mysterious genetic predisposition that both motivates them to meditate and leads them to high levels of proficiency. More convincing are results from a larger group of seasoned meditation adepts like Mingyur. His remarkable neural performance was part of a larger story, a one-of-a-kind brain research program that has harvested data from these world-class meditation experts. Richie’s lab continues to study and analyze the mass of data points from these yogis, in an ever-growing set of findings unparalleled in the history of contemplative traditions, let alone brain science. <br>

<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 2882 <br>
Each of these yogis completed at least one three-year retreat, during which they meditated in formal practice a minimum of eight hours per day for three continuous years—actually, for three years, three months, and three days. That equates, in a conservative estimate, to about 9,500 hours per retreat. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 2886 <br>
Like Mingyur, they entered the specified meditative states at will, each one marked by a distinctive neural signature. As with Mingyur, these adepts have shown remarkable mental dexterity, instantly and with striking ease mobilizing these states: generating feelings of compassion, the spacious equanimity of complete openness to whatever occurs, or laser-sharp, unbreakable focus. </p>

All the yogis had elevated gamma oscillations, not just during the meditation practice periods for open presence and compassion but also during the very first measurement, before any meditation was performed. This electrifying pattern was in the EEG frequency known as “high-amplitude” gamma, the strongest, most intense form. These waves lasted the full minute of the baseline measurement before they started the meditation. </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 2913 <br>
This was the very EEG wave that Mingyur had displayed in that surprising surge during both open presence and compassion. <br>

<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 2917 <br>
Delta, the slowest wave, oscillates between one and four cycles per second, and occurs mainly during deep sleep; theta, the next slowest, can signify drowsiness; alpha occurs when we are doing little thinking and indicates relaxation; and beta, the fastest, accompanies thinking, alertness, or concentration. Gamma, the very fastest brain wave, occurs during moments when differing brain regions fire in harmony, like moments of insight when different elements of a mental puzzle “click” together. To get a sense of this “click,” try this: What single word can turn each of these into a compound word: sauce, pine, crab?* <br>
Note – Location 2920 <br>
Hmm. This is very interesting. Gamma must be related to emptiness practice. I only get this experience when I do that or whatever facet of Dzogchen meditation I can. Sometimes compassion also when it fires <em>all</em> sentient beings, this spontaneously visualisation of seeing all beings from their perspective and wishing them well. </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 2926 <br>
Ordinarily gamma waves from, say, a creative insight, last no longer than a fifth of a second—not the full minute seen in the yogis. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 2929 <br>
The location of these oscillations varies among brain regions; we can display alpha in one cortical location and gamma in another. </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 2930 <br>
In the yogis, gamma oscillations are a far more prominent feature of their brain activity than in other people. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 2932 <br>
The contrast between the yogis and controls in the intensity of gamma was immense: on average the yogis had twenty-five times greater amplitude gamma oscillations during baseline compared with the control group. </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 2934 <br>
yogis like Mingyur seem to experience an ongoing state of open, rich awareness during their daily lives, not just when they meditate. The yogis themselves have described it as a spaciousness and vastness in their experience, as if all their senses were wide open to the full, rich panorama of experience. <br>

No brain lab had ever before seen gamma oscillations that persist for minutes rather than split seconds, are so strong, and are in synchrony across widespread regions of the brain. </p>

when volunteers new to meditation were trained for a week in the same practices that the yogis do, there was absolutely no difference between the volunteers’ brains at rest and when they were trying to meditate on cue, as the yogis did.3 </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 2956 <br>
the yogis’ remarkable talent at entering a specific meditative state on cue, within a second or two, itself signals an altered trait. This mental feat stands in stark contrast to most of us meditators who, relative to the yogis, are more like beginners: when we meditate, it takes us a while to settle our minds, let go of distracting thoughts that overwhelm our focus, and get some momentum in our meditation. </p>



<p>Highlight(blue) – Location 2963 <br>
In contemplative science, an “altered state” refers to changes that occur only during meditation. An altered trait indicates that the practice of meditation transformed the brain and biology so that meditation-induced changes are seen before beginning to meditate. </p>

First bring to mind someone you care about deeply and relish the feeling of compassion toward that person—and then hold that same loving-kindness toward all beings, without thinking of anyone in particular.5 </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 2984 <br>
Tellingly, the yogis but not the beginners showed the final part of the brain’s arc to action, a jump in activity in the motor centers that guide the body when we are ready to move—to take some decisive action to help, even though the subjects were lying still in a scanner. The yogis showed a huge boost in these circuits. The involvement of neural regions for action, particularly the premotor cortex, seems striking: to emotional resonance with a person’s suffering it adds the readiness to help. </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 2991 <br>
Intriguingly, yogis hearing sounds of people in distress while they were doing loving-kindness meditation showed less activity than others do in their postcingulate cortex (PCC), a key area for self-focused thought.6 In the yogis, hearing sounds of suffering seems to prime a focus on others. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 2993 <br>
They also show a stronger connection between the PCC and the prefrontal cortex, an overall pattern suggesting a “down-regulation” of the “what will happen to me?” self-concern that can dampen compassionate action.7 </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 2996 <br>
Some of the yogis later explained that their training imbued them with preparedness for action, so the moment they encounter suffering they are predisposed to act without hesitation to help the person. This preparedness, along with their willingness to engage with someone’s suffering, counters the normal tendency to withdraw, to back away from a person in distress. <br>

An eighteenth-century Tibetan text urges meditators to practice “on whatever harms come your way,” adding, “When sick, practice on that sickness.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. When cold, practice on that coldness. By practicing in this way all situations will arise as meditation.”9 </p>

Since the essence of meditation is awareness, any sensation that anchors attention can be used as support—and pain particularly can be very effective in focusing. </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 3010 <br>
“open presence,” an attentional stance of letting whatever life presents us come and go, without adding thoughts or emotional reactions. Our senses are fully open, and we just stay aware of what happens without getting carried away by any downs or ups. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 3014 <br>
The moment the plate heated a bit—the cue for pain about to come—the control groups activated regions throughout the brain’s pain matrix as though they were already feeling the intense burn. The reaction to the “as if” pain—technically, “anticipatory anxiety”—was so strong that when the actual burning sensation began, their pain matrix activation became just a bit stronger. And in the ten-second recovery period, right after the heat subsided, that matrix stayed nearly as active—there was no immediate recovery. This sequence of anticipation-reactivity-recovery gives us a window on emotion regulation. <br>
Note – Location 3018 <br>
This I believe is exactly how sexual desire works as well. The anticipation can be just as strong as the actual sex. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 3022 <br>
For the yogis, their pain matrix showed little change in activity when the plate warmed a bit, even though this cue meant extreme pain was ten seconds away. Their brains seemed to simply register that cue with no particular reaction. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 3029 <br>
For these highly advanced meditators, the recovery from pain was almost as though nothing much had happened at all. <br>
Note – Location 3030 <br>
This non-stickiness applies to both pain and pleasure. It can make social dynamics quite different. Especially in say romantic relationships. Eg after sex one partner is still salivating at the experience but the other has already dropped it fully. </p>

When we take the self out of the picture, it seems, things go along with little effort. </p>



<p>Highlight(orange) – Location 3046 <br>
When long-term meditators reported “undistracted awareness,” “effortless doing,” “not efforting,” and “contentment,” activation in the PCC went down. On the other hand, when they reported “distracted awareness,” “efforting,” and “discontentment,” activation of the PCC went up.12 </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 3053 <br>
One metric for effortlessness here comes down to being able to keep your mind on a chosen point of focus and resist the natural tendency to wander off into some train of thought or be pulled away by a sound, while having no feeling of making an effort. This kind of ease seems to increase with practice. </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 3058 <br>
they began to reflect on the large span of expertise even within the so-called expert meditator group. This expert group actually ranged in practice hours from 10,000 to 50,000—a very large spread. </p>



<p>Highlight(orange) – Location 3062 <br>
When the team compared those with the most versus those with the least amount of practice, they found something truly striking: all of the increase in prefrontal activation was accounted for by those with the least amount of practice. For those with the most lifetime hours of practice, there was very little prefrontal activation. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 3068 <br>
The more amygdala activation in response to those sounds, the more wavering in concentration. Among meditators with the greatest amount of lifetime practice hours—an average of 44,000 lifetime hours (the equivalent of twelve hours a day for ten years) the amygdala hardly responded to the emotional sounds. But for those with less practice, (though still a high number—19,000 hours) the amygdala also showed a robust response. There was a staggering 400 percent difference in the size of the amygdala response between these groups! <br>
Note – Location 3071 <br>
That’s crazy. 19,000 hours to 44,000 hours difference, 400% </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 3073 <br>
What’s more, this means traits continue to alter even at the highest level of practice. The dose-response relationship does not seem to end even up to 50,000 hours of practice. <br>

The demo that evening used as subject the neuroscientist Francisco Varela. As Richie placed the electrodes on Francisco’s scalp, the view of Francisco was blocked. But when Richie completed his task and moved out of way, a loud chorus of laughter erupted from the usually very staid monks. Richie thought the monks were laughing because Francisco looked a bit funny with wires coming off his scalp electrodes like a big bundle of spaghetti. But that was not what the monks found funny. They were laughing because Richie and his team had told them of their interest in studying compassion—but they were placing electrodes on the head, rather than the heart! </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 3097 <br>
Richie’s team had data suggesting that with yogic training the brain becomes more finely tuned to the heart—specifically during compassion meditation. </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 3099 <br>
compassion in the yogis sharpens their sense of other people’s emotions, especially if they are distraught, and heightens sensitivity to their own bodies—particularly the heart, a key source of empathic resonance with the suffering of others. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 3102 <br>
“nonreferential” compassion. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 3105 <br>
Being present to another person—a sustained, caring attention—can be seen as a basic form of compassion. Careful attention to another person also enhances empathy, letting us catch more of the fleeting facial expressions and other such cues that attune us to how that person actually feels in the moment. But if our attention “blinks,” we may miss those signals. </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 3120 <br>
This highlights a weakness in what otherwise might seem quite impressive findings on the yogis: these data points are but glimpses of the altered traits that intensive, prolonged meditation produces. </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 3127 <br>
A word about the global significance of these yogis. Such people are very rare, what some Asian cultures call “living treasures.” Encounters with them are extremely nourishing and often inspiring, not because of some vaunted status or celebrity but because of the inner qualities they radiate. We hope nations and cultures that harbor such beings will see the need to protect them and their communities of expertise and practice, as well as preserve the cultural attitudes that value these altered traits. To lose the way to this inner expertise would be a world tragedy. <br>

<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 3145 <br>
The studies of beginners typically look at the impacts from under 100 total hours of practice—and as few as 7. The long-term group, mainly vipassana meditators, had a mean of 9,000 lifetime hours (the range ran from 1,000 to 10,000 hours and more). And the yogis studied in Richie’s lab, had all done at least one Tibetan-style three-year retreat, with lifetime hours up to Mingyur’s 62,000. Yogis, on average had three times more lifetime hours than did long-term meditators—9,000 hours versus 27,000. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 3149 <br>
A few long-term vipassana meditators had accumulated more than 20,000 lifetime hours and one or two up to 30,000, though none had done a three-year retreat, which became a de facto distinguishing feature of the yogi group. </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 3154 <br>
The vast majority of meditators in the West fall into the first level: people who meditate for a short period—a few minutes to half an hour or so on most days. A smaller group continues on to the long-term meditator level. And a mere handful attain the expertise of the yogis. <br>

A handful??? Man. How do we make that 10x, 100x, 1000x the number?? </p>

Compassion meditation shows stronger benefits from the get-go; as few as seven total hours over the course of two weeks leads to increased connectivity in circuits important for empathy and positive feelings, strong enough to show up outside the meditation state per se. <br>

Beginners also find improvements in attention very early on, including less mind-wandering after just eight minutes of mindfulness practice—a short-lived benefit, to be sure. But even as little as two weeks of practice is sufficient to produce less mind-wandering and better focus and working memory, enough for a significant boost in scores on the GRE, the entrance exam for graduate school. </p>



<p>Highlight(blue) – Location 3172 <br>
For example, in this range we see the emergence of neural and hormonal indicators of lessened stress reactivity. In addition, functional connectivity in the brain in a circuit important for emotion regulation is strengthened, and cortisol, a key hormone secreted by the adrenal gland in response to stress, lessens. </p>



<p>Highlight(blue) – Location 3177 <br>
And long-term practitioners show enhanced ability to down-regulate the mind-wandering and self-obsessed thoughts of the default mode, as well as weakening connectivity within those circuits—signifying less self-preoccupation. </p>

Consider the tale of a yogi who had spent years in a Himalayan cave on retreat. One day a traveler happened by and, seeing the yogi, asked him what he was doing. “I’m meditating on patience,” the yogi said. “In that case,” replied the traveler, “you can go to hell!” To which the yogi angrily retorted, “You go to hell!” That tale (like the one about the yogi in the bazaar) has served for centuries as a cautionary tale to serious practitioners, reminding them that the test of their practice is life itself, not isolated hours in meditation. A trait like patience should leave us unflappable no matter what life brings our way. The Dalai Lama told this story, clarifying, “There’s a saying in Tibetan that in some cases practitioners have the outward form of being holy people, which holds when everything is fine—when the sun is shining and the belly is full. But when they are confronted with a real challenge or crisis, then they become just like everyone else.”5 </p>

We’ve all heard it takes someone 10,000 hours of practice to master a skill like computer programming or golf, right? Wrong. In reality science finds that some domains (like memorization) can be mastered in as little as 200 hours.

For one, the data suggests that meditating for one session daily is very different from a multiday or longer retreat. Take a finding that emerged unexpectedly in the study of seasoned meditators (9,000 hours average) and their reactivity to stress7 (see chapter five, “A Mind Undisturbed”). The stronger the connectivity between the meditators’ prefrontal area and amygdala, the less reactive they were. The surprise: the greatest increase in prefrontal-amygdala connection correlated with the number of hours a meditator had spent in retreat but not with home hours. <br>
Note – Location 3270 <br>
Big key. There can be grounds for developing more CCRs and other long-term retreat centres. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 3270 <br>
Along these lines another surprising finding was from the study of breath rate. A meditator’s hours of retreat practice most strongly correlated with slower breathing, much more than daily practice.8 </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 3272 <br>
on retreat is that there are teachers available who can provide guidance—like a coach. And then there is the sheer intensity of the retreat practice, where meditators typically spend up to eight hours (and sometimes much more) a day in formal practice, often for many days in a row. And many or most retreats are at least partially in silence, which may well contribute to building intensity. All of that adds up to a unique opportunity to amp up the learning curve. </p>

amateurs and experts has to do with how they practice. Amateurs learn the basic moves of the skill—whether golf, chess, or, presumably, mindfulness and the like—and very often level off after about fifty hours of improving through practice.

The Visuddhimagga advises practitioners to find as a guide someone more experienced than they are. This ancient list of potential teachers starts at the top with, ideally, direction from an arhant (the Pali word for a fully accomplished meditator, someone at the Olympic level). If none is available, it advises, just find someone more seasoned than you—at the very least, they should have read a sutra, a passage from a holy text—if you have read none. In today’s world, that might be the equivalent of getting instruction from someone who had tried out a meditation app—it’s better than nothing. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 3295 <br>
Which forms of practice are most helpful to which people? Matching the student to the method has ancient roots. In the Visuddhimagga, for instance, meditation teachers are advised to carefully observe their students to assess which category they fit in—“greedy” or “hateful” types being two examples—all the better to match them to circumstances and methods most suitable. </p>



<p>Highlight(yellow) – Location 3298 <br>
for the greedy (who, for instance, first notice what’s beautiful), bad food and uncomfortable lodgings and the loathsomeness of body parts as the object of meditation.

For example, for those prone to ruminating and worrying about themselves, a helpful starter practice might be mindfulness of thoughts, where they learn to regard thoughts as “just thought,” without getting wrapped up in their content (or yoga, as Jon found).

Are altered traits add-ons to our nature, or uncovered aspects that were there all along? At this stage in the development of contemplative science it is difficult to weigh in on either side of this debate. There is, however, an increasingly robust corpus of scientific findings showing, for example, that if an infant watches puppets who engage in an altruistic, warmhearted encounter, or ones who are selfish and aggressive, when given the choice of a puppet to reach for, almost all infants choose one of the friendly ones.16 </p>

The yogis who came to Richie’s lab all practiced in a Tibetan tradition that holds the ideal that, eventually, people everywhere can be freed from suffering of all sorts—and that the meditator sets out toward this enormous task through mind training.

The sense of a life mission centered on practice numbers among those elements so often left on a far shore, but that may matter greatly. Among others that might, in fact, be crucial for cultivating altered traits at the level found in the yogis: </p>



<p>Highlight(pink) – Location 3421 <br>
An ethical stance, a set of moral guidelines that facilitate the inner changes on the path. Many traditions urge such an inner compass, lest any abilities developed be used for personal gain. Altruistic intention, where the practitioner invokes the strong motivation to practice for the benefit of all others, not just oneself. Grounded faith, the mind-set that a particular path has value and will lead you to the transformation you seek. Some texts warn against blind faith and urge students to do what we call today “due diligence” in finding a teacher. Personalized guidance. A knowledgeable teacher who coaches you on the path, giving you the advice you need to go to the next step. Cognitive science knows that attaining top-level mastery requires such feedback. Devotion, a deep appreciation for all the people, principles, and such that make practice possible. Devotion can also be to the qualities of a divine figure, a teacher, or the teacher’s altered traits or quality of mind. Community. A supportive circle of friends on the path who are themselves dedicated to practice. Contrast that with the isolation of many modern meditators. A supportive culture. Traditional Asian cultures have long recognized the value of people who devote their life to transforming themselves to embody virtues of attention, patience, compassion, and so on. Those who work and have families willingly support those who dedicate themselves to deep practice by giving them money, feeding them, and otherwise making life easier. Not so in modern societies. Potential for altered traits. The very idea that these practices can lead to a liberation from our ordinary mind states—not just self-improvement—has always framed these practices, fostering respect or reverence for the path and those on it. We have no way of knowing how any of those “left-behinds” might actually be active ingredients in the altered traits that scientific research has begun to document in the lab. </p>
